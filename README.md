<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<img src="quote.png">
<p> Machine Learning has gained traction in recent years. However, training and validating machine learning requires the availability of labeled data at scale. The new demands of data ensure that data collection will always be a consistent struggle. </p>

<h3>Text Mining</h3>
<p>For mining text datasets, we use a set number of classes, each consisting of a .txt file with text from an amount of webpages.</p>
<h3>Image Mining</h3>
<p> Computer Vision datasets are supported by AlphaMine.
