				Nevera: a name with provenance            

The name given to a quick, sudden and mighty Mediterranean storm, that races across the open sea off Croatia, a Nevera is extremely powerful and charged by lightning.
Striking with exceptional speed and severity, our new generation of hypercar proudly carries the name but also the characteristics of this unique meteorological force of nature.

				EXTRAORDINARY TECHNOLOGY, EXCEPTIONAL ENGINEERING            

				Precision engineering that pushes performance to the edge of possibility and beyond. Introducing the technology that makes Nevera.             



				Why electric?            

				Electric is genesis. Pioneered by Croatian engineer and futurist Nikola Tesla, electric is one of the earliest and most effective forms of power. By specialising exclusively in electric performance, we’re able to engineer and extract the most extreme performance from our hypercars.             




























										Four motors                                    

										Four motors. Four wheels. Each of Nevera's wheels are independently driven by one dedicated electric motor which channels torque accordingly to give unprecedented control and agility.                                    






R-AWTV

										Power where you need it. Instantly. Nevera calculates the amount of torque deployed to each wheel over 100 times a second to achieve the desired driving dynamic through Rimac's intelligent All Wheel Torque Vectoring system (R-AWTV). Stability, safety, efficiency and ultimate agility when you need it most.                                    











										Monocoque core                                    

										Core strength. Solid structure. Beneath the skin lies a carbonfibre monocoque with bonded carbon roof, integrated structural battery pack and rear carbon subframe. Designed and developed entirely in-house, Nevera's structural core is lightweight, powerful and exceptionally strong.

The Rimac Nevera (pronounced: [rǐːmat͡s něʋeːra]) is an all-electric sports car designed and manufactured by the Croatian automotive manufacturer Rimac Automobili.[4] The first production prototype car was released in August 2021.[5][6]  Nevera production has been limited to 150 vehicles.[7][8] Having completed crash testing for homologation, Rimac plans to deliver the Nevera to customers in mid-2022.[9][10] The Nevera is manufactured in the same factory and at the same rate (of roughly 1 per week) as the Pininfarina Battista, which is based on the same platform.[11]

Overview[edit]
 Rimac C_Two
The car was unveiled at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show as the Rimac C_Two; it was later renamed to the Nevera upon its launch. It is the automaker's second car after the Rimac Concept One and is described as "the ultimate electric hypercar driving experience".
The name Nevera comes from the Croatian word for sudden and short storms, usually accompanied by lightning, which occur primarily along the Croatian Adriatic coast.[12][13]

Development[edit]
The Nevera was initially revealed as the C_Two concept car. Since 2018, Rimac spent over three years refining the car as part of an extensive test and development programme. Almost all key components of the Nevera are designed and manufactured at Rimac's headquarters near Zagreb, Croatia.[14]
During the global homologation process, the company constructed 4 prototypes for different testing purposes.[1]
In June 2020, Rimac opened a new facility in Veliko Trgovišće which serves as the assembly for Nevera homologation prototypes as well as production vehicles for customers. At full capacity, it was planned that the facility would produce 4 vehicles per month, including an additional 13 prototype vehicles for homologation testing to destruction and 10 pre-production vehicles, by the end of 2020.[1]
In February 2022, after four years of testing, the crash test program for the global homologation of the Nevera was completed, when US passive safety tests were completed. European crash testing had already been completed in 2021.[15]
In August 2022, Nico Rosberg (Formula One World Champion, 2016) took delivery of car number 1 of 150.[16]

Performance[edit]
Each of the Nevera's four wheels is individually driven by surface-mounted magnet motors. Combined, they produce a total of 1,427 kW (1,914 hp) and 2,360 N⋅m (1,741 lbf⋅ft) of torque. A single-stage gearbox links the front and rear wheels.[17]
The Nevera allegedly has the ability to accelerate from 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) in 1.85 seconds, making it potentially the fastest-accelerating production car in the world. According to Rimac Automobili, it accelerates from 0–161 km/h (0–100 mph) in 4.3 seconds, 0–299 km/h (0–186 mph) in 9.3 seconds, and has a top speed of 412 km/h (256 mph).[17]
On 13 August 2021, the YouTube channel "Drag Times" tested a pre-production Nevera at Famoso Raceway, Bakersfield, California. After making several runs down the 1⁄4 mile track, the following performance results were published:

0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) (1ft): 1.90s
0–100 km/h (0–62 mph): 2.00s
0–161 km/h (0–100 mph): 3.61s
0–209 km/h (0–130 mph): 5.36s
0–241 km/h (0–150 mph): 6.88s
97–209 km/h (60–130 mph): 3.42s
161–241 km/h (100–150 mph): 3.27s
100–200 km/h (62–124 mph): 2.95s
201 m (1⁄8 mi): 5.64 @ 213 km/h (132.33 mph)
402 m (1⁄4 mi): 8.58 @ 270 km/h (167.51 mph)
Features and specifications[edit]
While also advertising a maximum range of 647 km (402 mi) on the NEDC cycle,[18][19] and 550 km (340 mi) on the WLTP cycle, the car is also claimed to be able to complete two consecutive laps of the Nürburgring with a negligible drop in performance.[20] Rimac claims the car was designed to be very durable and could be driven hard. In addition to this, the car is technologically capable of Level 4 of autonomous driving[21] with full advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS).[22] If connected to a fast charger, it can be recharged to 80% in less than 30 minutes.[23] The car features an entirely new design and does away with the conventional doors, now incorporating butterfly doors instead. It also has a fire extinguisher in the back held in by a leather strap embossed with the words "In case of hill climb, extinguish fire", a reference to The Grand Tour host Richard Hammond who crashed a Concept One during a hill climb, causing it to catch on fire.[24]

Reception[edit]
Jonathan Lopez of Top Speed magazine acclaimed the Nevera stating that "it is an absolute game changer, and not just in the EV segment. Between the onboard tech and mind-boggling performance specs, this machine has the goods to take on the best of the best".[25]
Tom Ford of Top Gear tested the early prototype in March 2020. He praised the "punch out" in the corners despite the weight of the car, as well as giving plenty of feedback, concluding that "it tastes good raw, even without the torque-vectoring wizardry. ... But with a base car that shows this level of promise, and a company that focuses on fun rather than figures, this bodes well".[26]
Vlad Savov of The Verge criticized its looks by describing them as "anonymous and unexciting", and describing them as less flamboyant to that of Lamborghini Huracán, but admitted that the car is "more forgiving and accommodating than most other hypercars", but also stated that the readouts on the infotainment were too distracting.[27]

Production version[edit]
Top Gear, in its 2021 review of a pre-production vehicle, praised the "head spinning performance, incredible tech, ultra-stiff chassis, engineering and build quality" but noted that the brakes need getting used to and some detail finessing, giving it 9 out of 10.[28] Chris Perkins, writing for Road & Track, called the acceleration "savage and unrelenting", noting that the "step up in performance between 'quite fast' and 'so fast it makes breathing difficult' is quite something", and ultimately calling it "the most advanced, most powerful, quickest car out there".[29] Car and Driver had similar impressions in its review, stating that "hypercars like the Nevera aren't for everyone, but there's no denying its significance as the moment a battery-powered car toppled the Bugatti Chiron. The internal-combustion engine may never catch up".[30] Robb Report journalist Ben Oliver noted in his impressions while driving the car that "the noise adds to the drama, as much psychological as physical, in a way no other road car can match, making for a dangerously charismatic split personality worth every one of its seven figures".[31]

The best example of this, so far, is the 1813 horsepower Nevera from the Croatian start-up Rimac. It’s easily the Bugatti Chiron of EVs. Unlike any EV before it, the Nevera uses a one-piece carbon-fiber monocoque chassis. Its huge 117.0-kWh battery pack is part of the car's rigidity and has cells spread under each occupant’s seat to save space and allow for a lower seating position. At roughly 5100 pounds, the Nevera isn’t a lightweight, but it's got plenty of athleticism and tire to help it glue to the pavement around the curviest of roads. The Nevera can recover energy at a rate of as much as 300 watts and does it smoothly without interrupting normal driving to recharge its battery. A 2,000,000 euro price tag is converted to USD upon order will keep the majority of people from ownership, but its 150-unit limited production run will also give the Nevera an exceptionally rare appearance. What's New for 2022?2022 is the first year of the Rimac Nevera and likely the last as its total planned production is limited to just 150 vehicles. Pricing and Which One to Buy Nevera$2,050,500Production is limited to just 150 units, but no matter how you order it, there’s really no wrong way to order an 1813-horsepower fully-electric rocket ship. EV Motor, Power, and PerformanceProving there’s no such thing as too much horsepower, the Nevera uses a four-motor fully-electric powertrain that uses a carbon-sleeved permanent-magnet AC synchronous motor to each wheel with a one-speed direct-drive transmission. While 1877 horsepower is the battery's maximum output, 1813 horsepower is the most power that can be made at the motors. Not like you’ll be able to tell a difference. Both front motors generate 295 horsepower and 207 pound-feet of torque, while the two rear drive units are good for 644 horsepower and 664 pound-feet each. Rimac claims the Nevera can get to 60 mph in 1.85 seconds and a quarter-mile in 8.6 seconds. That would be quicker than anything we’ve ever tested, but those estimates come with one major asterisk; they were earned on a prepped drag strip. The 258 mph top speed claim, however, few will be crazy enough to attempt View PhotosRimacMore on the Nevara Coupe2022 Rimac Nevera Hypercar Is AliveMate Rimac Stamps His Name on the FutureRange, Charging, and Battery LifeLet’s be honest, in a car with more horsepower than a Formula One racer, outright EV range doesn’t take highest priority. But, because eventually, all good things must come to an end, or in the Nevera’s case, a low battery percentage, we should point out that despite its mind-bending performance, the Nevera earned a 205-mile range estimate from the EPA. How quickly that range shrinks after a few seconds of cruising at the car’s 258 mph, well, that’s up to the millionaires to decide. The Nevera uses a massive 117.0-kWh battery pack that runs between and behind the seats and seatbacks with additional wings of cells spreading under the driver and passenger’s side footwells and acts as an area of additional rigidity for the car's chassis. For more information about the Nevera’s fuel economy, visit the EPA's website.Fuel Economy and Real-World MPGeAccording to the EPA, the Nevera achieves earns a 53, 53, and 54 MPGe ratings for its combined, city, and highway estimated values. We haven't run the Nevera on our 75-mph highway fuel-economy route, which is part of our extensive testing regimen, so we can't evaluate its real-world mpg. For more information about the Nevera's fuel economy, visit the EPA's website.Interior, Comfort, and CargoWhile outright performance is at the forefront of the Nevera’s mission, Rimac wanted the feeling of sitting in one to match the excitement of driving it. While each of the 150 Neveras can be custom built with various materials, colors, and stitching to accommodate any opulent look, the carbon monocoque from which the entire car is fastened can’t be ignored. Bare carbon is present across the center fascia of the dashboard, as well as around the center console and covering the steering column. Suede and shiny billet aluminum are also common materials inside the Croatian all-electric hyper car.  View PhotosRimacThe Car and Driver DifferenceOur Comprehensive Car Testing ExplainedWhy We Test: Every Number Tells a StoryInfotainment and ConnectivityThe Nevera’s command center consists of three screens that display various vehicle controls and information. A large infotainment screen is centrally-mounted with billet-machine hardware that allows it to fold forward for extra storage space, and its heavy-dutiness helps prevent the display from succumbing to the car's intense lateral g acceleration. A passenger-side LCD shows speed, acceleration, and other info that’s sure to raise any co-pilot’s heart rate. A wireless smartphone charger is also available and found above the center console.

                                Rimac Nevera is the World’s Fastest Accelerating Production Car                            

	                            13 August, 2021                            






















While on its way to its American debut at ‘The Quail: a Motorsports Gathering’ in California, the Rimac Nevera made a quick stop at the drag strip at Famoso Raceway. Back in June, it set the unofficial world record for the fastest accelerating production car but now, with Famoso Raceway officials and the experts from DragTimes, it was time to do it again.
Driven by Brooks Weiselblat from Dragtimes, with standard Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires – just like every Nevera – the car lined up at Famoso drag strip, with the air temperature at 37°C/98F and track temperature 65°C/149F.
With its Launch Control engaged – done by simply putting your left foot on the brake and flooring the accelerator – the Nevera prepared to unleash the full force of its 1,914hp powertrain through four separate electric motors. Having lifted a foot off the brake, the Nevera’s advanced control systems,  Including Rimac All-Wheel Torque Vectoring 2, constantly monitored which wheels had the most grip, portioning out the power to minimize wheelspin and maximize acceleration as it launched down the strip.
And in just a blink of an eye, the Nevera set the ¼-mile in a production car world record time of 8.582 seconds, at a top speed of 167.51mph. The run was the 11th of the day in quick succession, without any performance degradation between the runs, and can be seen in full on the Dragtimes Youtube channel.

















Nevera’s previous unofficial world record quarter-mile time for a production car was set at 8.62 seconds earlier this year during testing in Croatia on an unprepared airstrip. Rimac has now beaten its own record and produced times that can be independently verified by third parties – with lots of performance still to be unlocked through over-the-air software updates.
Miroslav Zrnčević, test and development driver said:
This was our first test on a VHT (glued) surface, so we did not know what to expect. At first we were hitting less than expected ¼ mile times (8,7 and 8,8 seconds) than we did on a normal, non-prepped surface in Europe. The track temperature was 65°C and we had to do some adjustments. Our traction control learns the surface on each run and adjusts the torques on the wheels. After some adjustments and different tire warm-up strategies we managed to get better results. Brooks helped with his experience of staging the car and we managed to set the world record for the fastest accelerating production car and also beat our own 1/4 mile record. Still, we are confident that the Nevera has much more to give and that we can go even quicker with more experience and testing on this kind of surface. We will be back.
Mate Rimac, Founder and CEO said: “Our business started with a BMW 3 Series that I had converted to electric power, which went on to set a number of FIA acceleration records. But what we have produced today is on a completely different level. The Concept_One, back in 2011, was the fastest accelerating EV in the world, running the quarter-mile in 9.9 seconds. We’ve now broken that record with a standard production car by 1.4 seconds. With four independent motors, each individually controlled, we have so much flexibility over how the car accelerates and corners, giving us a huge advantage over any combustion-engined vehicles.
“But Nevera is about so much more than speed. With the largest battery pack ever fitted to a production car, it can travel 340 miles on a single charge. With in-house-developed Rimac All-Wheel-Torque Vectoring 2 it’s as agile as it is fast, and with electrically adjustable dampers and active aerodynamics it’s comfortable and quiet on a cruise, and a performance machine on a track.”
Designed, engineered, tested and manufactured in-house at Rimac Automobili’s global headquarters in Croatia, Nevera’s name proudly carries its Croatian heritage. A nevera is a mighty Croatian storm, known for its speed, ferocity and energy – a fitting name therefore for both the Nevera’s character and ability. Able to transform in a split second from a supple grand tourer to an all-out force of nature, Nevera is charged by lightning much like its namesake.

2022 Rimac Nevera Review: A New League Of Hypercar

by Karl Furlong




The Rimac Nevera is an electric hypercar like no other, with stupendous performance figures that simply defy logic and seem sent from the future. With four electric motors producing a combined 1,914 horsepower, it will blitz the 0-60 mph run in an unbelievable 1.85 seconds. And, while many EVs run out of steam at higher speeds, the Nevera will reach 258 mph at the top end. Yes, this Croatian carmaker has entered a new league of performance with the Nevera, a car that will leave the Bugatti Chiron eating its dust, although it's the similarly powerful Lotus Evija that the Nevera will have to answer to. An aerodynamic masterpiece, and with an advanced monocoque construction, the Nevera is not only capable in a straight line but is a superbly balanced hypercar too. In every facet, the Nevera proves itself as a worthy successor to the Concept_One. Only 150 people will have the privilege of driving off in one of these as Rimac keeps production numbers low.





2022 Rimac Nevera Changes: 🚙What's New?

The 2022 Rimac Nevera is an all-new engineering marvel. It arrives as a four-motor hyper EV with performance that beggars belief. Based on the C_Two prototype and a successor to the Concept_One, every aspect of the Nevera has been enhanced in some way. Rimac says that the Nevera has the world's most advanced monocoque construction, including the bonded carbon roof. It even has a drift mode... in an EV. Production of the Nevera will be slow, at a rate of just one per week, so when deliveries begin later in 2022, some customers will have to wait longer than others for their cars. Only 150 examples of the Nevera will be produced.

2022 Rimac Nevera

Revealed midway through 2021, the Rimac Nevera compels us to rethink everything we thought we knew about hypercars. It has four electric motors producing a combined 1,914 horsepower and 1,740 lb-ft of torque. That allows the Nevera to comfortably reach 60 mph in under two seconds. The Nevera has sleek looks, a modern cabin filled with the latest technologies, and a rigid monocoque structure. Active aerodynamics help to make it as slippery as possible, while maintaining downforce at incredibly high speeds.


Specs and Trims: Rimac Nevera Models And Configurations

As a successor to the Concept_One, the Rimac Nevera has big shoes to fill but it does so with aplomb. Powered by four electric motors - one at each wheel - the Nevera has the traction it needs to put down a staggering 1,914 hp. An all-wheel torque vectoring system is standard, and it can process 100 calculations per second to provide the best mix of traction and power depending on the situation. The monocoque chassis is claimed to be the most rigid of any production car. Despite its sensational performance, a large 120-kWh battery pack should allow for a decent range of 340 miles, although that's based on the WLTP cycle and will decrease when evaluated by the EPA.Inside, there's a modern and well-trimmed cabin with three TFT screens and comfortable bucket seats. From here, the driver can tap into the artificial intelligence Driver Coach system that will help you set the best possible lap times.

Rimac Nevera Coupe Full Specs




            It takes a lot of effort to successfully channel nearly 2,000 hp, but Rimac has pulled off this miraculous feat in the Nevera. From its active aerodynamics to each wheel being powered independently by its own motor, the automaker has been able to coax devastating, but also controllable, performance from its hypercar. At saner speeds, the Nevera is surprisingly comfortable and its neatly trimmed interior boasts all the technologies and comforts expected. There are multiple screens displaying key information, and power bucket seats that are both comfortable and supportive. 

        



Nevera Exterior

Considering its breathtaking performance, the Rimac Nevera is actually not the most dramatic hypercar to look at. That's not to say that it won't turn heads, but it's obvious that the focus has been on function over form, and aerodynamics above all else. The car rides on 20-inch wheels wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires. The active aerodynamic systems are found all over the Nevera. There is a front underbody flap, a hood flap that reduces drag, and an active rear wing. In Range mode, the underbody vents are closed and the rear wing is retracted for lower drag. As for that rear wing, it also functions as an air brake that can activate in just 0.2 seconds. Finally, there are active flaps in the rear valance that manipulate airflow and improve cooling.

Dimensions

At 187 inches in length, the two-door Nevera is significantly longer than the Bugatti Chiron. The Rimac is 78.2 inches in width, a low 47.6 inches in height, and has a 108.1-inch wheelbase. At 4,740 pounds, the Nevera is over 500 lbs heavier than a Chiron, no doubt because of the car's electronic components. Just as well, then, that it has almost 2,000 hp to wipe out any hint of a disadvantage caused by its weight.

Exterior Colors

Rimac promises that no Nevera is made exactly the same, so we hope that means that the Rivera has a broader color palette than what's shown on the company's official website. As it stands, the only colors for the Nevera are Gunpowder Grey, P5 Silver, E-Racing Blue, Polar White, and Riviera Blue. The white and silver do a good job of contrasting with the various carbon panels, but E-Racing Blue evokes the kind of energy we'd associate with such a viciously quick machine.


Nevera Performance

The numbers are simply staggering. With four electric motors, the Rimac Nevera produces a sensational 1,914 hp and 1,740 lb-ft of torque. Each wheel is powered independently by one of these motors, allowing for maximum traction and dramatically different dynamic behavior depending on which mode the car is in.It all translates to a 0-60 mph time of only 1.85 seconds, although Rimac specifies that this is on a high-friction surface with a one-foot roll-out. No gas-only models can compete with that, and even the 1,020-hp Tesla Model S Plaid - the fastest sedan in the world - is slower. The quarter-mile time is just as impressive, with the Nevera taking just 8.582 seconds for this. That's comfortably quicker than the previous record attained by the Plaid of just over nine seconds. A top speed of 258 mph is attainable in the Nevera, but that would no doubt quickly drain the battery. Still, just knowing it can be done is what sets apart this electric hypercar from everything else.

Engine and Transmission

It's not just the total outputs of 1,914 hp and 1,740 lb-ft that are impressive. It's how the four electric motors work together so that the driver can actually use all of it. These four independent, surface-mounted, carbon-sleeve, permanent-magnet electric motors are positioned at each wheel. The Nevera also has four independent inverters and gearboxes. This enables all-wheel drive with software-controlled torque vectoring.The rear motors are more powerful, making 653 hp each, whereas those in front make 299 hp each. At the back, there is a double single-speed direct-drive gearbox, effectively two gearboxes in one housing positioned between the motors. In front, there are two single-speed gearboxes but these are each placed at the outer end of the axle.The whole setup requires five cooling systems and two refrigerant circuits. The final piece of the complex puzzle is a 120-kWh lithium manganese nickel battery.To drive, the AWD Rimac is quite docile at first. You know the power is there, but you can navigate congested streets effectively if you need to. When space opens up, though, nothing can quite prepare you for the organ-repositioning acceleration that follows. It is mind-bendingly fast, and shockingly easy to reach illegal speeds.

Handling and Driving Impressions

This was always going to be a tricky area for engineers as we move into the era of electric hypercars. There is no getting away from the fact that EVs are a lot heavier than their conventionally-powered counterparts, and managing that weight while still engaging the driver is a monumental challenge. Of course, the Nevera is off to a great start since each wheel is independently powered by its own motor. Together with the Rimac's trick software, the car's dynamics can be dramatically altered at the touch of a button.The basics are up to scratch, though. The Nevera has fast steering and grip levels that will rarely, if ever, be challenged by most drivers. The electric steering isn't quite as pure as sports cars of old, with the sense that the electronics are more involved than they should be, but hardware isn't enough when you're managing this much power and weight. Rimac positioned the battery low in the floor which helped to achieve a lower center of gravity and a 48:52 front/rear weight distribution.The company's all-wheel torque vectoring 2 system replaces traditional electronic stability and traction control programs. Reading the road ahead, it makes more than 100 calculations every second and directs the ideal amount of torque to each corner. The driver has an amazing amount of control over the system and can switch between numerous configurations like a front-wheel to rear-wheel-drive setup, or even drift the Rimac if the desire arises. It would take a long time to delve into all of this car's dynamic layers, but the speed it is able to carry through corners is astonishing, especially in Track mode.Dial down the tempo, switch to Comfort mode, and the Nevera is also accomplished. With a double-wishbone suspension and electronically controlled dampers, it provides a comfortable enough ride that won't leave you fatigued on longer trips. The car is also adept at not being knocked off course by mid-corner bumps. In certain conditions, the regenerative braking means that you don't need the brake pedal to slow down. When you do need to stop in a hurry, the Brembo CCMR carbon-ceramic discs with six-piston calipers provide powerful, fade-free stopping.


Nevera Gas Mileage

The EPA has not yet published MPGe specs for the Rimac Nevera, but the absence of an ICE engine means you can avoid the shocking fuel economy and costs of something like a Bugatti Chiron - not that anyone buying a Nevera will be concerned about running costs, of course. According to the automaker, the Nevera has a range of up to 340 miles based on the WLTP cycle. We expect that number to be closer to 300 miles when the EPA shares its findings.The 120-kWh battery can be recharged from 0-80% in as little as 19 minutes with 500 kW DC fast charging, when this becomes available. With 350 kW charging, that time increases to 25 minutes, and to 30 minutes at 250 kW.

 









Nevera Interior

The two-seater cabin has been designed to suit both track driving and grand touring. Rimac has divided the space into two zones, with the top segment being focused on performance and driving pleasure, and the lower section containing infotainment controls and comfort feature settings. There is a trio of TFT screens that can be customized to show the amount of information desired by the driver. While far from a Bentley in terms of luxury, the Nevera is built to a high standard. This is noticeable in details like the billet aluminum used for the rotary controls, and the soft upholstery for the seats.

Seating and Interior Space

There is only space for two lucky individuals in the 2-door Rimac Nevera sports car, and that's exactly how it should be. There is enough legroom and headroom for even taller people over six feet, and the cabin feels appreciably wide too. The seats are snug, with good side support so that you don't go flying out of them at the speeds this car is capable of. Unlike some other hypercars, the Rimac affords the driver good visibility which makes it more practical to drive every day.

Interior Colors and Materials

Climb inside the Nevera and you'll see a lot of exposed carbon fiber, a reminder of how extensively utilized this material is throughout the car's construction. It's paired with generous lashings of leather and Alcantara, and overall, it feels and looks special. It's not as glossy or opulent as the interior of a Bentley or even a high-end Mercedes-Benz, but Rimac wasn't exactly looking to compete with those brands. A nice touch is the billet aluminum used for the rotary controls and switches. A wide range of customization options will be available, with customers being able to choose bespoke trim and materials.


Nevera Trunk and Cargo Space

The Rimac Nevera coupe has a long but shallow trunk at the back. It measures only 3.5 cubic feet in size, and because of its unusual shape, taller items simply won't be able to fit in there. Then again, we never expected the Nevera to be a serious cargo hauler. In the cabin, there is possibly the smallest glovebox you will find on any production car; anything bigger than a slim diary is unlikely to fit. Beneath the center armrest is a dedicated space for your mobile phone, and behind that are two speed-tested cupholders. Essentially, these can hold bottles in place even when you're hooning the Nevera in Drift mode. The central infotainment screen can also be tilted forward to reveal a small storage area behind it.

Nevera Infotainment and Features

Features

Rimac hasn't published a complete list of the Nevera's features, but it comes with most of what you'd expect plus a few advanced extras dedicated to the driving experience. The Nevera is equipped with climate control, three TFT displays, power-adjustable seats, a rearview camera, a power-adjustable steering column, and push-button start. The majority of functions, including the power mirrors and seats, are adjusted via the central touchscreen. Via this screen, the driver can also make adjustments to the suspension, throttle response, and steering assistance.The Rimac comes with the world's first artificial intelligence driving coach that helps one to extract the best out of the car. This system uses 12 ultrasonic sensors, 13 cameras, and six radars to provide both audio and visual guidance. Rimac promises that it will become available in 2022 and will be launched via over-the-air updates.


Infotainment

The Nevera has three TFT screens in its high-tech cabin, and the company has designed its own infotainment software from scratch. This includes a digital instrument cluster, a large central touchscreen, and another narrow screen ahead of the passenger. The gauge cluster can be adjusted via buttons on the steering wheel and displays speed information, settings for the suspension, and a lot more.The central touchscreen can be used to access navigation and music settings, but it is also used to adjust comfort features like the climate control system. Real-time telemetry is downloadable to a laptop or smartphone, and customers can easily access information like charging speed and battery status via Rimac's in-house app, accessible on both Android and iOS devices. Both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also offered, although Rimac hasn't released specific information about the car's sound system.

 









Rimac Nevera Coupe Problems and Reliability

Until the Nevera starts reaching customers, we won't have access to any review or data about the car's reliability or potential recalls.While warranty information is also unknown, Rimac does say that the four electric motors are completely maintenance-free for their entire operating life. You can also bet that the electric components will be covered by a mandatory warranty in the US, which is a minimum of eight years/100,000 miles.


Nevera Safety

Unsurprisingly, no Rimac Nevera safety reviews have been conducted by the IIHS and the NHTSA. Considering the price of the Rimac Nevera, along with its limited production run, this will likely never happen. However, Rimac has submitted Nevera mules for crash testing purposes, so the safety systems are up to scratch.


US NHTSA Crash Test Result

NHTSA safety ratings are not available at this time.


 









Key Safety Features

The monocoque passenger cell on its own should be considered a safety feature. With aluminum and carbon fiber crash structures and deformation zones, it should hold up extremely well in the unfortunate event of a collision. The Nevera also comes with a driver's airbag, a passenger airbag, and side airbags. Torque vectoring with traction and stability control, along with that powerful carbon-ceramic braking system, will all help the driver maintain control.With 13 cameras, six radars, and 12 ultrasonic sensors, the Nevera is literally keeping an "eye" (or several eyes) on its surroundings and transferring this information back to the driver. The surround-view camera system is a useful feature. Eventually, the Nevera will be capable of Level 4 partially autonomous driving.


Verdict: 🏁Is the 2022 Rimac Nevera a good car?

Where does one even begin with this car? The Rimac Nevera accesses a level of performance that we never previously thought possible. Cars with a third of the Nevera's power are less able to put it down to the ground as well as this car does. Yes, the straight-line speed dominates the headlines, but the Nevera is not a one-trick pony. It can corner with the best of them, and it'll also glide along the highway confidently. Rimac has packed in so much technology to get the best out of the driving experience that it'll take a long time to unpack all of the car's talents. While that may prove tiresome to the typical Bentley owner, it'll thrill a newer generation - if they can somehow afford the $2.3-million price tag, of course. As a technical and engineering achievement, the Nevera is remarkable.


🚘What's the Price of the Rimac Nevera?

The Rimac carries a price tag of 2 million euros. At current rates, that translates to about $2.3 million. Few hypercars occupy space in this price range. The Koenigsegg Gemera plug-in hybrid comes in at under $2 million, and Bugatti doesn't have a fully electric car on the market at all yet. The Lotus Evija is perhaps the Nevera's closest competitor at this stage. It is also a fully electric hypercar, it also makes nearly 2,000 hp, and it costs nearly as much as the Nevera.

 









Additional Packages

Rimac promises that every Nevera will be unique, which is little surprise since just 150 examples will be made. However, the company hasn't gone into great detail about what packages, if any, are on offer. We do know that customers will be able to tailor the interior as they see fit, likely for a substantial cost.


🚗What Rimac Nevera Model Should I Buy?

There is only one Rimac Nevera trim on offer. If you have the means to acquire one, consider yourself fortunate. All Neveras are mechanically identical but you'll be able to choose your own interior and exterior colors, interior materials, and more.

2022 Rimac Nevera vs Tesla Model S Plaid

You could buy around 17 new Plaids for the price of a single Nevera, so how are these two even competitors? They aren't, but the Tesla's phenomenal performance makes it one of the very few cars on the planet that can come close to the Nevera in a straight line. Despite being almost 1,000 hp down, the tri-motor Model S Plaid is barely slower to 60 mph. The Tesla also has a better range, space for five occupants, and a large trunk. Oh, and did we mention its MSRP is over $2 million less? The Nevera is a hypercar in every sense of the word, though. It has been engineered to do things beyond the realm of the Plaid. Whereas the Tesla struggles on a track and has disappointing standard brakes, all the Nevera's components have been designed to match its explosive power. We know which one we'd rather park in the garage, and it's not the one with a back seat.

2022 Rimac Nevera vs Bugatti Chiron

Hypercars have always been about massive engines, blaring exhaust notes, and sheer theater. The Chiron is blessed with all of these qualities in abundance, but the statistics say that it has been easily surpassed by the Nevera. With its 8.0-liter quad-turbocharged W16 engine and dual-clutch gearbox, the Chiron sounds and feels totally different to the Nevera. We'd also say that the Chiron has a nicer, more special interior, and that it's more comfortable at top speed on the autobahn. But the Nevera will smoke it off the mark and probably when the road gets twisty too. The Rimac ushers in a new era of hypercars that are friendlier to the planet but quicker and with a more customizable driving experience. We're torn between the Chiron's more traditional approach and everything new that the Nevera has to offer, so at this stage, we'd rather take one of each, and we suspect those with the means to own either will likely own both, too.

Facebook. Amazon. One of the most fascinating things about the digital world in which we now live is that the tech titans which dominate it seemingly came out of nowhere, and not that long ago either. The old order got scrambled, fast.
Legacy automotive is doing its best as the electric revolution gathers serious momentum but from the land of Tesla – Nikola that is, not Elon Musk’s outfit – comes a company whose new car turns everything you thought you knew about hypercars on its head. Should you still be clinging to the notion that EVs are somehow missing something, prepare to be converted. Forever.Advertisement - Page continues below
You’ll have heard of Croatian upstart Rimac, of course, and if you read TopGear.com regularly you’ll be acquainted with the company’s CEO and founder, Mate Rimac. As with the likes of Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and yer man Musk, a certain cult of personality has grown up around Mate, partly because the internet likes that sort of thing, but mainly down to the fact that he has a brain the size of a planet and doesn’t stop until the ideas pinging around his head are made real.
Like this car?
Yep. The new Nevera, formerly known as the C_Two, is a machine that aims for the stratosphere despite hailing from a country with precisely zero indigenous car industry and a population of four million.
Let’s just run through the headline facts. Naming a car is always tricky and Nevera doesn’t entirely work in the English language, but a nevera is an electrically charged storm that whips up unexpectedly off the Mediterranean and can pummel the Croatian coast at speeds of up to 155mph. Appropriate, then, if somewhat more leisurely than its new four-wheeled namesake.
The car’s architecture encompasses a 6,960-cell, 120kWh Lithium/Manganese/Nickel battery pack in an H shape along the spine and behind the cockpit. There are four surface-mounted permanent magnet motors driving each wheel individually, the most advanced torque vectoring ever achieved and a power output equivalent to 1914bhp and 1,740lb ft of torque. (If it sounds similar to the Pininfarina Battista’s set-up, that’s because it is – Rimac supplies Pininfarina, amongst others, including Aston Martin, Ferrari, Hyundai, Koenigsegg and Porsche).Advertisement - Page continues below
A pair of single-speed gearboxes are connected to the front and rear wheels. The Nevera has a range of 340 miles WLTP and hooked up to a 500 kW charger takes 19 minutes to go from zero to an 80 per cent state of charge.
Top speed, please...
It is said to be 258mph, but Rimac’s chief test driver Miro Zrnčević admits to us that despite a highly rigorous test programme, they haven’t quite got there yet. What we do know is that it accelerates to 60mph in 1.85 seconds, 100mph in 4.3secs, and demolishes the quarter mile from a standing start in 8.6secs. Oh, and 186mph is dusted in 9.3 seconds, which makes the Nevera marginally faster than a contemporary F1 car. Consider that it weighs 2,150kg and you get some idea how utterly nuts the physics are here. It also makes you wonder how on earth that mass can be properly constrained, but we’ll come to that shortly.
Rimac plans to make 150 units with prices starting from £1.7m. This is pretty punchy stuff from a guy whose first family home didn’t have running water or mains electricity, and whose initial foray into the business came when he fitted an EV powertrain into a rather shaggy E30 BMW 3 series. That was in 2008. When I interviewed him in early 2019 Rimac had 500 employees. Now there are 1,000, and the foundations will shortly be laid on a new 200,000 square-metre campus on the outskirts of Zagreb which will house 2,500 staff, with as much emphasis on education and healthcare as technology.
Rimac’s knowledge of batteries, inverters and e-motors is so advanced that the company develops and engineers virtually everything itself. It’s also because Mate Rimac is out-pacing everyone else. Clearly, this is where the big play is and what’s attracting the investors. Yet Mate is adamant that the Nevera isn’t just a pretty showcase for the company’s expertise. He’s absolutely committed to creating a hypercar that can take the fight to all the established big guns: in quality and execution as well as performance, and a big chunk of his new HQ is devoted to Nevera manufacture. To paraphrase Johnny Rotten, he means it, man.
Is there science to its design?
While there’s a certain familiarity to the Nevera’s form language, this ain’t no piece of exotic vapourware. Given the car’s vast performance potential, the shape is largely dictated by aerodynamic and cooling requirements, although it does still feature Rimac’s signature ‘cravat’ motif ahead of the rear wheelarch.
“The neck-tie has provided a symbol of Croatian strength and identity since the 17th century,” says the company’s design director, Adriano Mudri, although like everything it’s also functional: in this case acting as an air intake for the rear cooling systems.
The Nevera’s body – the diffusers, intakes, splitters and radiators – have been worked over tirelessly by an army of CFD experts to deliver a 34 per cent improvement in aero efficiency compared to early prototypes. The front bonnet profile, underbody flap, rear diffuser and rear wing can each move independently, and switching from a low drag mode to a high downforce setting has a profound effect: the latter increases downforce by 326 per cent.
Packaging all those batteries is no mean feat, so props to all involved for delivering such an elegant looking car. Rimac wanted something that was easy to use, with a decent H-point and above average-for-a-supercar-visibility.
Job done: the butterfly doors eat into the roof in a Ford GT-like manner and you don’t need to be a Soviet gymnast or Yoga master to get in and out. The view ahead is clear, the car easy to place on the road, rear visibility not bad. And when you pull those doors shut they close with the resounding finality of a cell door in a Belarussian detention centre. Watch the Nevera on the move and the more you appreciate the nuances of its shape.
Photography: Jonny FleetwoodWhat's the verdict?“The first true pure-electric hypercar is a sensation, as is the company that makes it”There’s a lot to unpack here. This is the first true pure-electric hypercar to land, and there’s definitely a pioneering feel to the Rimac Nevera. This thing’s quarter mile time blitzes the Bugatti Chiron Sport’s and its pace everywhere is intergalactic. But the most powerful ICE cars generate huge character, and it’s their engines and the noise they make that tend to linger longest in the memory. Even the highest of high performance can become… one-dimensional.
But we’re happy to report that the Nevera engages on multiple levels, and transcends the idea that its primary focus is ones, zeroes and algorithms. It feels like a car that’s been engineered and developed by people who aren’t just way ahead of the technological and software curve, they have an innate feeling for the hardware too.
Put all the elements together and you have a car that isn’t just hugely entertaining, it also feels like a genuine milestone. Think of Rimac as a sort of techno Pagani, with as much focus on artistry as artificial intelligence. And remember that the company has a whole load of other stuff going on, too. What a trajectory these guys are on.Next: DrivingAdvertisementFeatured7Seven used hot hatches for less than £10k – that aren’t the usual suspects710BMW X112Top Gear's guide to buying a used Ford Fiesta20Top Gear's top 20 electric carsAdvertisementFeatured7Seven used hot hatches for less than £10k – that aren’t the usual suspects710BMW X112Top Gear's guide to buying a used Ford Fiesta20Top Gear's top 20 electric carscompare car financePowered bymore on this carTake one for a spin or order a brochureorder a brochurebook a test drivePowered byFeatured7Seven used hot hatches for less than £10k – that aren’t the usual suspects710BMW X112Top Gear's guide to buying a used Ford Fiesta20Top Gear's top 20 electric carscompare car financePowered bymore on this carTake one for a spin or order a brochureorder a brochurebook a test drivePowered byTrending this weekElectricTop Gear's top 20 electric carsTop Gear AdviceSeven used hot hatches for less than £10k – that aren’t the usual suspectsElectricThis is the Rolls-Royce Spectre, RR's first fully-electric carElectricHas a university solved rapid charging for electric cars?ElectricThis tiny EV is the fastest-accelerating car in the worldElectricNew Rolls-Royce Spectre: inside the world's most luxurious electric carContact UsPrivacy PolicyCookies PolicyManage cookiesExternal link to Site TermsExternal link to Code of conductExternal link to Advertise with usExternal link to Top Gear MagazineThis website is made by BBC Studios Distribution.BBC Studios is a commercial company that is owned by the BBC (and just the BBC).

We slid in, and the faint rumble of the climate-control system made a reasonable impression of an idling engine. Was this intentional? It's unclear, but it worked for us. As we got underway, the whine of the four motors and their attendant reduction gears gave off an impression that the thing was alive—no need for the synthetic space-commander theme music you find in a Porsche Taycan or a BMW i4. The motor sounds coming from all four corners through the carbon-fiber conduit that is the Rimac's one-piece chassis connected us to the machine like no other EV has.The Nevera brings an almost-preposterous 1813 horsepower to bear via a quad-motor propulsion system that assigns one carbon-sleeved permanent-magnet AC synchronous motor and direct-drive transmission to each wheel. (That figure is slightly less than the peak output we've reported before, as engineers on-site at the drive event confirmed that 1877 hp is the battery's maximum output, but 1813 hp is the maximum that can make it to the motors.) The car's total output at full whack is naturally rear biased, because while each front motor is rated at 295 hp and 207 lb-ft, the two rear drive units are good for a monster 644 horses and 664 lb-ft apiece. The Nevera is said to be capable of a 1.85-second leap to 60 mph and a quarter-mile time of 8.6 seconds. Those numbers were earned on a prepped drag strip, but we don't think they're too far off what we might measure when we get the chance. Rimac also claims a top speed of 258 mph.View PhotosRimacThe actual output can be tailored through the five drive modes. Range mode makes use of 100 percent of the front-motor torque while limiting rear-motor torque to 30 percent of maximum. Because of the wildly different torque output available at each end, that works out to a near 50/50 split from the pavement's point of view. In practice, though, we rarely saw the rear power meter light up while we cruised in Range, giving us the impression that this mode is more heavily front biased than all of that math suggests. And the Nevera needs all the range help it can get, as the EPA methodology gives it a stingy 205-mile range figure.Cruise and Sport modes cap front and rear output at 70 percent of their respective limits. The difference between these two modes amounts to steering assist and the damping profile of the electronically adjustable KW-supplied dampers. Track mode cranks both of those parameters up another notch, but importantly, it also lets go of the reins so the motors at each end can deliver up to 100 percent of their rated maximums. Then there's Drift mode, which puts the front motors to bed while allowing the driver to light the rears up to 100 percent of their potential.View PhotosRimacMore on Rimac2021 Rimac Nevera May Upend the Hypercar ParadigmMate Rimac Stamps His Name on the FutureRimac is rightfully very proud of the advanced torque vectoring this quad-motor powertrain has facilitated, but we found it wanting in Cruise and Sport modes, where its ability to read the road and make instantaneous decisions about available grip seemed less refined than our own eyeballs and local knowledge. Caution and a conservative approach are of course appreciated with the ruinous potential of 1800-plus horsepower on tap. But it didn't take much to get the system to balk at attempts to put the power down in corner-exit situations that a Hyundai Veloster N would have agreed to enthusiastically. Things only seemed to come right when we dialed in Track mode, which allowed us to roll into the accelerator as intended because of its more aggressive torque-vectoring map and more permissive traction control.Thankfully, beside the above five default modes, there are two other customizable ones. We'd use them to modify the Cruise and Sport settings to have the Track mode's torque vectoring and traction-control permissiveness. Frankly, though, it'd be nice if the car weren't quite so stingy, particularly in Sport mode.  View PhotosRimacThe chassis, on the other hand, is otherworldly. The rigidity of its carbon-fiber structure is immense, and the front and rear control-arm suspensions bolt directly to it. The only appendages are the front and rear crash structures that support the bodywork. Additional chassis strength comes from the massive 117.0-kWh T-shaped battery pack, a fully stressed chassis member that runs between and behind the seats and seatbacks, with additional wings of cells spreading out under each occupant's feet, but not under their seats. The absence of cells under the seat allows for a low seating position that makes a supercar roofline possible.With that kind of platform rigidity, the Nevera's chassis tuners could have created a brutal, track-focused machine. But this car is intended for mere mortals (albeit extremely wealthy ones) to drive on normal roads, and so the chassis tuning is instead set to be tolerable on poor roads. You can also see this philosophy in the tires, which are 275/35ZR-20 front and 315/35ZR-20 rear Michelin Pilot Sport 4S rubber that shows a bit of sidewall. There's likely a practical element at work here, too, as a car pushing 5100 pounds needs tires that enclose a bit more air volume than something like a set of rubber-band 22s, especially when you consider the aero downforce at the very high speeds it's capable of.View PhotosRimacThis is not meant to imply that the Nevera can't turn a corner, because it absolutely stays glued to the pavement when pushed hard. Alert readers may remember that we carped about light steering when we sampled an earlier prototype, but the engineers have apparently made changes since then, because the effort and cornering force buildup is intuitive, natural, and laser focused. On-center response gets a bit less surgical when the car is in Range mode, but that seems entirely appropriate. The Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, on the other hand, feel a bit touchy the first time you get on them, but that's mainly if you turn regenerative braking fully off. Leave it on the maximum setting and it can recover energy at 300 watts, which amounts to a healthy 0.4-g deceleration rate. The regen system programming is uncommonly progressive in the way it responds when you lift off the accelerator, and there's no weird surge if you transfer your foot to the brake pedal asking for more.You'll never hear Nico Rosberg, the former F1 champ who took delivery of Rimac #001, complain about interior space. But we found the cabin to be on the tight side for a six-foot-two driver. Headroom is reasonable, but it'd be nice if the seat went back farther. The battery pack and rear firewall prevent that, however, so you'd better not be an NBA star. The seat adjustments are in the central touchscreen with a lot of other secondary controls, which is not ideal, but this car is unlikely to to see much driver swapping.View PhotosRimacThere are no column stalks, so controls for the turn signals and wipers are on the steering wheel. The start button and shift selector are to the driver's left, and a pair of larger bilevel knobs to the right. One cycles through the drive modes and five levels of stability control, and the right knob allows you to vary the output of the front and rear pair of motors. It's a lot to sort through, but tweaking the stability control did seem necessary to reconfigure Cruise and Sport to our liking.The Nevera is every bit the moonshot you'd hope given the price of 2 million euros (which is converted to dollars at time of order). And yet, it doesn't feel like a science project. The outrageous output and impressive customizability make its electric powertrain as fascinating as its most potent internal-combustion counterpart. The Nevera makes us optimistic about the future of ultrahigh performance.SpecificationsSpecifications
