Rigid Structure
A material mix of aluminum and steel help to achieve the best structural rigidity, and increased occupant safety.


2
Impact Protection
Combined with impact-absorbing rails and center pillar reinforcements, the strength and support of the rigid battery pack provides protection from every side.


3
Very Low Rollover Risk
The position and weight of the floor-mounted battery pack provides a very low center of gravity—allowing for a very low rollover risk.

The Tesla Model 3 is a  compact executive sedan that is battery powered and produced by Tesla.[7] Limited production of the Model 3 began in mid-2017, with the first production vehicle rolling off the assembly line on July 7, 2017.[8][9][10] The official launch and delivery of the first 30 cars took place on July 28.[11]
The base Model 3 delivers an EPA-rated all-electric range of 272 miles (438 km) and the Long Range version delivers 358 miles (576 km).[12] According to Tesla, the Model 3 carries full self-driving hardware, with periodic software updates adding functionality.[13][14][15]
The Model 3 was marketed as being more affordable to more people than previous models by Tesla. Since early 2020, the Model 3 is the bestselling electric car in world history,[16] and, in June 2021, became the first electric car to pass the 1 million global sales milestone.[17] The Model 3 has been the world's top selling plug-in electric car (PEV) for three years running, from 2018 to 2020.[18][19][20] It has also been the bestselling PEV in the United States for three consecutive years, 2018 to 2020,[21][22][23] the top selling PEV in Europe in 2019,[24] and the bestselling PEV in China in 2020.[25]

History[edit]
 Rear view
In an interview for Wired Science recorded during 2006, Elon Musk presented the Model 3 as likely being affordable by most people able to purchase new cars.[26]  In 2008 the car was stated to be a family car.[27] In 2017 Tesla added that the Standard Range version of the all-electric car would have an estimated EPA-rated range of 215 miles (346 km), a five-passenger seating capacity, front and rear trunks, and promised sports-car levels of acceleration performance.[better source needed][28][29] Tesla said it would have a 5-Star safety rating and have a drag coefficient of Cd=0.23.[30] This is lower than the Tesla Model S drag coefficient of Cd=0.24, which, in 2014, was the lowest among the production cars of the time.[30]
Within a week of unveiling the Model 3 in 2016, Tesla revealed they had taken 325,000 reservations for the car. These reservations represented potential sales of over US$14 billion.[31][32] By August 2017, there were 455,000 net reservations.[33][34]
Industry experts were dubious when, in May 2016, Tesla announced its decision to advance its 500,000-total-unit build plan (combined for Model S, Model X, and Model 3) to 2018, two years earlier than previously planned, in order to accelerate its target for Model 3 output.[35][36][37] As predicted, there were "production bottlenecks" and "production hell". In May 2016, Tesla issued US$2 billion in new shares to the stock market to finance the plan.[38]
The company plans for the Model 3 are part of Tesla's three-step strategy to start with a high-price vehicle and move progressively towards lower-cost vehicles, while the battery and electric drivetrain were improved and paid for through the sales of the Roadster, Model S, and Model X vehicles.[39]
On April 18, 2018, Tesla updated its production target to 6,000 vehicles per week by the end of June 2018, an increase from its previous target of 5,000 vehicles per week which was previously promised at earlier dates.[40][41][42][43] On July 1, 2018, Elon Musk announced that Tesla had met its production goal of 5,000 cars in a week.[44][45][46]
On February 28, 2019, Tesla announced the availability of the lower-cost, highly anticipated, $35,000, Standard Range trim.[47] However, on April 12, 2019, Tesla announced that the Standard Range model would no longer be available for ordering online, but only over the phone or in stores.  Autopilot, previously a $3,000 option, was included in all versions of the Model 3 except for the Standard Range, while each version's price only increased by $2,000.[48] In February 2019, the Model 3 passed the Chevrolet Volt to become the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car in the U.S.[49][50] Model 3 sales surpassed the Nissan Leaf in early 2020 to become the world's all-time top selling plug-in electric car.[16]

Model naming[edit]
During an interview recorded in 2006 Musk referred to "Model 2" (later Tesla Model S), and to "Model 3".[26]  The Model 3 was codenamed Tesla "BlueStar" in the original business plan in 2007.[51][52][53] An intended name of "Model E" was not used owing to Ford's trademark for an electric vehicle expected to be released by Ford in early 2019.[54] Model 3, originally stylized as "Model ☰", was announced on Musk's Twitter account on July 16, 2014.[55] A 2015-presentation by JB Straubel used the name "Model III".[56]  As of 2016[update] Musk had wanted the three models to spell SEX, but settled for "S3X".[57] In early 2017, after trademark opposition regarding Adidas's three stripes logo,[58] the triplicate horizontal-bar stylization was abandoned and changed to a numeric "3".[59]

Market[edit]
 About 125 people in line to pre-order a Model 3 in Walnut Creek, California, in 2016
In September 2015, Tesla announced that the Model 3 would be unveiled in March 2016.[60] In January 2016, Musk said that the first official pictures of the car will be revealed at the end of March 2016.[61] Delivery would begin in late 2017 first on the U.S.'s west coast and then move eastwards.[62] Potential customers were first able to reserve a car at Tesla stores or online on March 31 with a refundable deposit of US$1000.[63][64] In February 2016, Tesla indicated that the unveiling would be on March 31, 2016.[65] Employees of Tesla[66][67] and SpaceX were given early access to Model 3 reservations,[68] and about 10,000 signed up without discount,[69] scheduled to receive the first batch of cars.[70][63] Current owners of Tesla vehicles got priority sales after employees but before the general public, as a reward for helping pay for the development of the Model 3.[63] (Employees and current owners were likely to be more tolerant of early production flaws:[71] both the Model S and the Model X had several problems at the start of their production,[72][63] and have since improved.)[73]
On the morning of March 31, 2016, tens of thousands of people waited in lines to place the refundable deposit to reserve a Model 3 for 2017 delivery.[74][75] During the Model 3 unveiling event, Tesla said that over 115,000 people had reserved the Model 3 in less than 24 hours prior;[76][77] more cars than Tesla had sold by that time.[31] Twenty-four hours after opening reservations, Tesla had advanced orders for over 180,000 cars.[78][79] Two days later, Tesla said they had 232,000 reservations.[31][80]
One week after the unveiling, Tesla said it had over 325,000 reservations, more than triple the number of Model S sedans sold by the end of 2015.[31][32] Musk said that 5% of reservations correspond to the maximum of two vehicles allowed per customer, "suggesting low levels of speculation",[81] and that 93% of Model 3 reservations are from new buyers who do not currently own a Tesla.[63] The previous record for advance deposits on a car was the 1955 Citroën DS that had 80,000 deposits during the ten days of the Paris Auto Show, while the Model 3 had 232,000 reservations in two days.[31]
According to Tesla's global vice-president Robin Ren, China is the second-largest market for the Model 3 after the US.[82] Tesla said the number of net reservations totaled about 373,000 as of May 15, 2016[update], after about 8,000 customer cancellations and about 4,200 reservations canceled by the automaker because these appeared to be duplicates from speculators.[83][84] Upon its release in July 2017, there had been over 500,000 reservations for the Model 3,[85] with Musk later clarifying there were a net of 455,000 reservations outstanding, and an average of 1,800 reservations were being added per day.[33][34]

Design[edit]

In 2013 design chief Franz von Holzhausen said that the Model 3 will "be an Audi A4, BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class type of vehicle that will offer everything: range, affordability, and performance" that is targeted toward the mass market.[1][88] While technology from Tesla's Model S will be used in the Model 3,[89] it will be 20% smaller than the Model S[90] and have its own unique design.[91]
According to Tesla's CTO, JB Straubel, in October 2015, most Tesla engineers were working on the 3 rather than S or X.[92][93] Since electric cars have lower cooling needs than combustion cars, the Model 3 does not have nor need a front grille.[94] Musk intended for the final design to be released on June 30, 2016[95] but when the design was finished on July 27, it was not publicly released.[96] After the final design of the first Model 3, any further changes would be included in future versions of the Model 3.[97] The standard glass roof developed by Tesla Glass is made of the same glass used for Tesla's roof tiles.[98]

 Tesla Model 3 MY2021 refresh
In November 2020, the Model 3 was refreshed with cosmetic and internal changes, many carried over from the Model Y. The refreshed Model 3 replaced the chrome door handles, side mirror trim, window trim, and camera covers with a black finish. Double-paned front window glass, a powered trunk, new center console, and minor performance upgrades were added to all Model 3 trim levels. The car's engineering was updated to reflect Tesla's advances with the Model Y, including the introduction of a heat pump and proprietary octovalve that increases the car's heating and cooling efficiency.[99][100][101]

Production[edit]
As of December 2016[update], Tesla planned to increase the size of the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California, to accommodate Model 3 production.[102][103][104][needs update]

Production stages[edit]
In a 2013 interview, Jerome Guillen discussed "BlueStar" (codename for the Model 3 project), stating that Tesla was expecting to eventually produce 400,000 cars per year.[105]
In May 2016 Tesla told its suppliers that it intended to double earlier-announced[clarification needed] Model 3 production targets to 100,000 in 2017 and 400,000 in 2018 due to demand, which suppliers[106][107] and many experts viewed as unattainable.[108][109] In the Tesla Factory, paint lines for 500,000 automobiles commenced in 2015, and some stamping equipment for the Model 3 was operational by August 2016.[110] Tesla bought Grohmann Engineering, experienced in automated manufacturing, in January 2017. This acquisition launched Tesla Advanced Automation Germany, which Tesla said would develop manufacturing processes to be used initially in Model 3 production.[111] According to Tesla in late 2016, the company expected to invest between US$2 billion and US$2.5 billion in capital expenditures ahead of the start of Model 3 production.[111]
After the two Alpha prototypes were shown (silver and black; red was a shell) in April 2016, Tesla finished the design in late July 2016. Tesla ordered parts equivalent to 300 Beta prototypes in August 2016, preparing for development of the assembly line. As of August 2016, the company intended to make release candidates for testing prior to actual production.[112][113] Tesla began building Model 3 prototypes in early February 2017 as part of the testing of the vehicle design and manufacturing processes. Tesla said in late 2016 that initial crash test results had been positive.[111] Crash test results in mid-2019 were scored at 96% for protection of adults; 86% for protection of children and 74% for the way it handles "vulnerable road users" such as pedestrians. In addition, the Model 3's "safety assist" mode scored 94%.[114]
In October 2016 Tesla said its production timeline was on schedule.[115][116][117] Again in February 2017, Tesla said that vehicle development, supply chain and manufacturing are on track to support volume deliveries of the Model 3 in the second half of 2017. Limited vehicle production began in July 2017 and volume production was scheduled at that time to start by September 2017. As of February 2017, Tesla planned to ramp up production to exceed 5,000 vehicles per week in Q4 2017 and reach 10,000 vehicles per week in 2018.[111] However, Tesla missed their Q4 production target by a wide amount, as only 2,425 vehicles were produced during the entire 3-month period.[118][119]
Giga Nevada had been intended to produce battery packs for Model 3 and it was announced in January 2017 that Tesla would also manufacture drive units[clarification needed] at Giga Nevada.[120] In February 2017, Tesla said that installation of Model 3 manufacturing equipment was underway in the Fremont factory and at Giga Nevada, where in January, production of battery cells for energy-storage products began, which have the same form factor as the cells that will be used in Model 3.[111]

Deliveries[edit]

 2021 updated version of Model 3
In February 2016 Tesla expected to repeat the delivery schedule of the S and X models: selling at first the highest-optioned cars with higher margins, to help pay for production equipment.[121] However, after the lessons learned from the complicated Model X production, Tesla changed its delivery schedule in early 2017 to produce relatively simpler cars initially, in order to reduce production risk. The first mass-produced Model 3 cars were rear-wheel drive with the long-range battery.[122] Deliveries began in the second half of 2017 as predicted,[62] but not in the numbers Tesla had hoped. As industry experts had predicted, Tesla did not meet the announced delivery targets.[clarification needed][121][122] The first delivery was on July 7, 2017, to Musk himself[123] and the first 30 production units were delivered on July 28, 2017.[124]

2017[edit]
In early July 2017 Musk forecast at least six months of serious production difficulties.[147] Tesla's announced goal at that time was to produce 1,500 units in the third quarter of 2017, increasing to 5,000 per week by end of December 2017,[148] but only 260 vehicles were manufactured during the third quarter. The company blamed production bottlenecks, but said there were "no fundamental issues with the Model 3 production or supply chain" and expressed confidence about its ability to resolve the bottlenecks in the near future.[149][150]
Tesla delivered just 1,542 Model 3 cars in the fourth quarter of 2017,[126] about 2,900 less than Wall Street estimations, which were already halved previously after Tesla published the company's third quarter report.[151] By early November 2017, Musk had postponed the target date for manufacturing 5,000 of the vehicles per week from December 2017 to March 2018.[152][41] An analyst with Cowan and Company, an investment banking firm, said in November 2017 that "Elon Musk needs to stop over-promising and under-delivering".[153] Customer deliveries totaled 1,764 units in 2017.[125][126]

2018[edit]
Prior to a planned shutdown in mid-April 2018 to further increase production, Tesla produced more than 2,000 Model 3 vehicles for three straight weeks.[127] Global deliveries passed 100,000 units as of October 2018.[154] U.S. Model 3 sales hit 100,000 units in November 2018, reaching this milestone quicker than any previous plug-in electric model.[155]
During the first half of 2018, the Model 3 was the top-selling alternative fuel vehicle in California with 12,674 units, followed by the Toyota Prius conventional hybrid (10,043).[156]  The Model 3 was the top-selling plug-in electric car in the U.S. for 12 months in a row through December 2018, ending 2018 as the bestselling plug-in with an estimated 139,782 units delivered, the first time a plug-in car sold more than 100,000 units in one year.[157][22][158] Additionally, the Model 3 ranked as the bestselling luxury vehicle in the American market in 2018.[159] The Model 3 topped plug-in electric car sales in California in 2018, with 51,293 units registered, and was the state's best selling car in the near luxury category.[160][161]
The Model 3 was the world's best selling plug-in electric car in 2018.[19] In 2018, Elon Musk predicted that eventual global demand would likely be between 500,000 and 1 million Model 3 cars per year— ranking in between the BMW 3 Series and the Volkswagen Golf.[162]

2019[edit]
 The Model 3 has been the world's best selling plug-in electric car for three years in a row (2018 to 2020).[18][19][20]

Retail deliveries in Europe and China began in February 2019.[163][164]  Delivery of the first right-hand drive vehicles began in June 2019, starting with the UK[165] and later in Australia and New Zealand.[166] Similarly to how the first US-made Model 3s were delivered in July 2017, the first Chinese-made Model 3 cars were delivered to employees at the end of 2019.[167]
In January 2019 the Model 3 overtook the Model S as the U.S. all-time best selling all-electric car,[168] and, the next month, also passed the Chevrolet Volt to become the all-time top selling plug-in electric car in the U.S.[49]
The Tesla Model 3 ended 2019 as the world's best selling plug-in electric car for the second consecutive year, with just over 300,000 units delivered.[19][20] The electric car also topped annual plug-in car sales in the U.S. (158,925) and California (59,514) markets for the second time in a row.[157][160][23][169] And again listed as the California's best selling car in the near luxury category in 2019.[169]
The Model 3 also ranked as the best selling plug-in car in Europe in 2019, with over 95,000 units delivered in its first year in that market, and outselling other key premium models.[24] It also set records in Norway and the Netherlands, not only as the top selling plug-in car but also as the best selling passenger car model overall.[170][171] The sales volume achieved by the Model 3 in 2019 (15,683) is the third largest in Norwegian history, exceeded only by the Volkswagen Bobla (Beetle) in 1969 (16,706), and Volkswagen Golf in 2015 (16,388).[172] The Model 3 set a new record in the Netherlands for the highest registrations in one month (22,137) for any single plug-in vehicle in Europe.[173]
The Model 3 also was the top selling plug-in car in Canada, Spain, Belgium, Denmark, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Mexico.[174][175]

2020[edit]
Until 2019, the Nissan Leaf was the world's best selling plug-in electric car, with global sales of 450,000 units by December 2019.[176] The Tesla Model 3 surpassed Leaf sales in early 2020 to become the world's best selling plug-in electric car ever.[16] Global sales totaled about 814,000 units overall up to December 2020.[18][125][126][133][135] The Model 3, with 365,240 global deliveries, was the world's best selling plug-in passenger car in 2020 for the third consecutive year.[19][20][18]
In 2020, the Model 3 was the bestselling plug-in car in China (137,459) and the U.S. (95,135).[21][25] The Model 3 also was the most popular plug-in electric car in California in 2020 (38,580), as well as the state's best selling car in the near luxury category.[177] The Model 3 has topped both California's and the U.S. national plug-in car sales for three years in-a-row, from 2018 to 2020.[21][22][23][177]

2021[edit]
In 2021, the Model 3 became the all-time bestselling electric vehicle in the Netherlands with over 78,996 cars registered at the end of June 2021.[178] The Model 3 became the first electric car to sell over 1 million units globally in June 2021.[17]
It was also the bestselling electric vehicle of 2021 in the UK, with 34,783 registered, beating the second most popular electric car, the Kia e-Niro, by over 22,500 registrations. These figures also made the Model 3 the second bestseller in the UK new car market in 2021, only beaten by the Vauxhall Corsa, a cheaper B-segment vehicle. The 9,612 Model 3s sold in December were more than double the sales of any other car in that month.[179]
In October 2021, Hertz car rental ordered 100,000 full-price Model 3 cars for its rental fleet.[180][181]

Concerns[edit]
In May 2018 Consumer Reports found "big flaws, such as long stopping distances in our emergency braking test and difficult-to-use controls", finding the braking distance was worse than a Ford F-150 full-size truck, and branding the Model 3 "not recommended".  Tesla responded to the claims with concern and, over the next weekend, released an OTA update for the anti-lock braking algorithm.  Consumer Reports, impressed with the prompt OTA update, verified the improved braking performance and changed their rating to a recommended model.[182][183]
In February 2019 Consumer Reports revoked the Model 3 recommendation because "many customers have reported problems with the [car], including loose body trim and glass defects."[184] As with Model S and Model X, Model 3 production flaws were reduced over time.[185]  In November 2019 Consumer Reports reinstated the Model 3 recommendation, claiming it was the fifth-most reliable of twelve compact luxury cars.[186]
During long-term testing of a Model 3 in December 2019, Car and Driver experienced a rear inverter short after 5,286 miles (8,507 km) and 3 months of ownership.[187]  It was their first long-term vehicle to suffer such a major failure while parked.[188]
In 2020, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, closure of the Shanghai factory at the end of January, and supply chain issues, Tesla used the 2.5 version processor instead of the 3.0 processor that Chinese users expected to find in their vehicles. This led to mass complaints. Tesla promised to upgrade the hardware free of charge once the supply chain is restored.[189]
The 2021 Tesla Model 3 vehicles built on or after April 27, 2021, had modified Forward Collison Warning (FCW) and Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) safety features, resulting in lower Consumer Reports and Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) scores. The change was from using Radar to Camera technology called Tesla Vision.[190] The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has open an investigation over phantom braking in these new vehicles.[191][192]
In May 2022, a relay attack was discovered where an attacker could gain remote control of a Model 3 (or a Model Y) if they could get within range of a Bluetooth key of the owner.[193][194]

Specifications[edit]
 First production Tesla Model 3 cars ready for the delivery event on July 28, 2017
Engineering and changes[edit]
When production began in 2017, the base Model 3 was announced to have a 50-kWh battery with a range of about 220 miles (350 km) while the optional 75-kWh battery would have a range of about 310 miles (500 km).[3][195] Tesla did not produce base Model 3s in 2017 or 2018. The battery uses 2170-size lithium-ion cells.[196][197]
The 350-volt (nominal, 400v max) Model 3 battery packs are made of four longitudinal modules each containing the groups (bricks). The Standard Range version carries 2,976 cells arranged in 96 groups of 31. The Long Range version carries 4,416 cells arranged in 96 groups of 46, and weighs[198] 1,060 pounds (480 kg) in a 0.40 m³ volume; a density of 150 Wh/kg.[199][200] The car's onboard AC/DC converter is 11 kW.[201] In Europe this requires Three-phase electric power, otherwise single-phase power is 7.4 kW.[202]
Tesla continues to improve the design of the 2170 battery cell and introduces incremental improvements into the manufacturing line periodically.[203] Tesla began manufacture of the "lighter, better, cheaper"[204] 2170 cell during 2018, with a company goal of reducing the cost of assembled battery packs to US$100 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) by December 2018, and moving the new cell into volume production at Giga Nevada during the first quarter of 2019. Electrek reported in late 2018 that the improved battery cell design was needed to further reduce battery costs as Tesla was planning to begin to deliver the Model 3 Standard Range for the promised base price of US$35,000 the following year.[204][needs update]
The inverter for the Model 3 drive unit uses 24 pairs of silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET chips rated for 650 volts[clarification needed] each.[205]
In July 2018 media reported that a Model 3 prototype was seen in California and Nevada while towing a trailer in an apparent evaluation of a tow bar.[206] In May 2019 Tesla started offering an optional tow bar rated for 2,000 pounds (910 kg) available with Standard Range Plus and Long Range for the European Model 3.[207][208][209] Towing a trailer may increase consumption by 40%.[210] Towing capacity 1,000 kg (2,200 lb). Towing is not available for the Performance model.
The Model 3 uses regenerative braking, which was tweaked and improved in October 2018 via a software update.[211]
In October 2019 Tesla released a software update including a 5% power upgrade and peak power optimization to owners of the Model 3, via software version 2019.36.2.1, which showed noticeable improvements in acceleration and overall speed.[212] In December 2019, Tesla offered Long Range dual-motor Model 3 owners who had software version 2019.40.2 the option to purchase a US$2000 "Acceleration Boost" software upgrade enabling a Sport driving mode,[213] advertised to reduce 0-60 mph (97 km/h) time from 4.4s to 3.9s.  Road testing confirmed better-than-expected acceleration with drivers in Sport mode reaching 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 3.67s from standstill and 3.47s with a 1-foot rollout.[214]
Structurally, the Model 3 is mostly steel, and most body panels are aluminum.[215][216]
The 185 cm (6.07 ft) width was chosen to fit with automated parking systems in Japan.[citation needed] Due to its smaller size, the Model 3 is expected to consume less energy than the Model Y, and thus have longer range.[217]
Traditional stability control is not made for dual-motor control or the faster response time in electric motors, and Tesla modified the control unit.[218] The motors have magnets arranged in a Halbach array.[219] The cooling system is integrated to reduce size and cost.[220]
Sometime during August 2020, Tesla added heating hardware to the Model 3's charge port which was enabled by software update later in the year to prevent ice buildup.[221][222]

Reception[edit]
 Tesla Model 3s in colors Silver Metallic (left) and Midnight Silver (right)
Car-design columnist and former car designer for GM Robert Cumberford said the Model 3 "is an excellent design" and praised the front fascia skin that he thinks is superior to the black plastic simulated grille of the pre-refresh Model S.[277][278] Cumberford praised the Model 3's minimalist design, and "elegant simplicity" akin to Apple products.[279] Although he criticized the car's spoiler, he said the Model 3 has a design that would age well, and "in 10 years it will still look contemporary and beautifully understated, not old and irrelevant."[279]
Motor Trend said the nose was controversial and polarizing, but probably intentionally so.[280] Vanity Fair and others compared the Model 3 to the Ford Model T for its intended affordability as a volume-produced electric vehicle[281][282][283][284] and for its limited set of options, namely range, wheels and exterior color of which all but white costs extra.[285] Automotive journalist Doug DeMuro said the Model 3 was better, though $2,000 more expensive, than the BMW 340i and that it was the "coolest car of the year," later clarifying that this was based on the "long waiting lists, obsessive interest and news stories."[286] Alex Roy said that DeMuro's review had concentrated on hardware details and missed out on the bigger picture.[284]
Automotive-industry analyst Toni Sacconaghi of AllianceBernstein said after driving one of the early Tesla vehicles in November 2017 that "Overall, we found the Model 3 to be a compelling offering, and believe it is likely to further galvanize the overall Electric Vehicle category." He was less impressed with build quality of the test samples. "Fit and finish on the two demo cars we saw—perhaps not surprisingly—was relatively poor." He said that there were quality issues at first with the Model X which led to some concern. "This is going to be a much, much higher-volume car, and if there are any quality issues, that could overwhelm the service centers and undermine the Tesla brand." Nonetheless, Sacconaghi was impressed with the ride quality, performance and interior space, and concluded that the 3 "risks cannibalizing the [much more expensive] Model S going forward."[287]
Road & Track's Bob Sorokanich said the "Model 3 proves that Tesla is thinking far beyond the edges of the Model S and X. Stepping out of the 3, you realize that, as far as the S and X pushed the envelope, they were always meant as intermediaries, stepping stones designed to draw people away from comfortable convention and into the future of the automobile. ... The Model 3 is Tesla at its most unabashed. It's an automaker finally willing to abandon the skeuomorphism of a false radiator grille, the tradition of a driver-oriented gauge panel."[288]
In 2018, a Model 3 was driven 606.2 miles (975 km) on a single charge, setting a hypermiling driving record.[289]
In early 2019, Kelley Blue Book announced that the Tesla Model 3 was the winner of the "Best Resale Value Award" for all automobiles in the US market "with a projected 69.3% resale value after 36 months and 48.7% after 60 months."[290]
Awards[edit]
Popular Mechanics named the Tesla Model 3 as the magazine's 2018 Car of the Year.[291] Model 3 was given the 2018 Design of the Year award by Automobile magazine.[279]
In the United Kingdom, the Model 3 was named 2019 Car of the Year by Auto Express magazine,[292] and 2020 Car of the Year by Parkers magazine, where it was also named "Best Electric Car" and "Best Company Car", and won the "Best Safety" award for any vehicle on the market.[293]
The Model 3 won best mid-size car in the 2019 Das Goldene Lenkrad Golden Steering Wheel awards.[294]
The Model 3 was named the top-rated electric car of 2019 by Edmunds.com, as well as being named Edmunds' top-rated Luxury Electric Vehicle for 2020.[295][296]
In late 2019, the Model 3 was also named a Top Safety Pick+ by the IIHS.[297] The Model 3 also won Car of the Year in Denmark, Car of the Year 2020 in Norway, and Swiss Car of the Year 2020.[298]
The Model 3 was named as UK Car of the Year 2020 by a panel of 29 motoring journalists. The director of the awards stated that the car's "technology, performance and range" were converting opinions in favor of electric vehicles.[299]
The car was chosen as one of the Top 10 Tech Cars by the IEEE in 2018.[300]
In January 2021, the Model 3 Standard Range Plus was named Large Electric Car of the Year by What Car? magazine.[301] What Car? awarded the Model 3 five stars out of five in its review of the car.[302]
Recalls[edit]
In December 2021, 356,309 2017–2020 Model 3 vehicles were recalled because of the possibility of damage to the rear view camera wiring harness caused by trunk operation.[303]

It's fast—especially the Performance trim—and it's agile, which means the Model 3 is an EV that driving enthusiasts like us can get behind. We even named it to our 2022 Editors' Choice list. Driving range is an impressive 358 miles per charge on the mid-level Long Range trim, so it's not necessary to charge the Model 3 every day. Its attractive entry price doesn't unlock the Model 3's full potential, though, and its fit and finish doesn't quite match alternatives such as the Chevy Bolt and Ford Mustang Mach E. Still, there's not a more inexpensive way to park one of Tesla's groundbreaking EVs in your driveway.Where This Vehicle Ranks1BMW i4STARTING AT: $56,8952Hyundai Ioniq 6STARTING AT: $44,0003Tesla Model 3STARTING AT: $48,4404Polestar Polestar 2STARTING AT: $49,8005Chevrolet Bolt EVSTARTING AT: $26,5956Nissan LeafSTARTING AT: $29,135What's New for 2022?Last year's Standard Range model has been renamed Rear-Wheel Drive and given a new kind of battery pack that uses lithium-ion-phosphate instead of nickel-cobalt-aluminum. Despite being less energy dense than the previous battery pack, estimated range for this entry-level model has increased to 272 miles. The Long Range trim also sees a slight uptick in its estimated driving range this year, to 358 miles per charge. Pricing and Which One to Buy Rear-Wheel Drive$48,440Long Range$59,440Performance$64,440The base rear-wheel drive model is a good value, but its 272 miles of estimated driving range may not be enough to eliminate range-anxiety for some drivers. We'd recommend the Long Range model that offers an estimated 358 miles of driving per charge.  All Model 3s come standard with heated front seats, navigation, and Tesla's Autopilot semi-autonomous driving system.EV Motor, Power, and PerformanceAs with most EVs, the Model 3 gains speed smoothly and almost silently, with the electric motor providing strong power from a stop. And it's fast—extremely so in some trims. The rear-wheel-drive Long Range model we tested sprinted from zero to 60 mph in 5.1 seconds. The Model 3 Performance rockets to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds—0.5-second faster than our long-term Model 3 Long Range. Like all Teslas, the Model 3 carries its battery under the floor, resulting in a low center of gravity. This helps it change direction crisply and feel planted and stable in corners. The steering is accurate and well weighted, with three different settings that adjust the level of steering effort. The ride is firm without being harsh; without the noise of a gas-powered engine, however, you do hear plenty of noise inside the cabin as the tires thwack and thrum over pavement imperfections.View PhotosTeslaMore on the Model 3 SedanTesla Prices Rise Once Again, Model X Hit HardestWhat the New Tesla Battery Pack Is About25 Bestselling Cars and Trucks of 2022 (So Far)Range, Charging, and Battery LifeThree distinct Model 3 trims are offered, each with a different estimated driving range. The base rear-wheel drive model is the most affordable, with a claimed range of 272 miles. Upgrading to the Long Range or Performance models increase the Model 3's estimated range to 315 miles for the Performance and an impressive 358 for the Long Range. Of course, this distance isn't easy to achieve, as we've found in our long-term Long Range Model 3 test vehicle. The Model 3 offers several different options for charging: Tesla's network of fast-charging stations called Superchargers, adapters for DC public-charging stations, 240- and 120-volt outlets, and a home-charging station.Fuel Economy and Real-World MPGeThe various versions of the Model 3 are rated between 113 MPGe and 141 MPGe by the EPA. Our test vehicle, however, managed only 84 MPGe when we took it on our 75-mph highway fuel-economy test. The Model 3 comes standard with aluminum wheels that are covered by plastic aerodynamic hubcaps. We wanted to know how much impact those hubcaps have on the car's driving range, so we tested it and were surprised to find that they helped more than expected. For more information about the Model 3's fuel economy, visit the EPA's website.Interior, Comfort, and CargoWe're not exaggerating when we say that the Tesla Model 3 has an interior unlike any other car on the market today. It's shockingly simple inside, with nearly everything controlled by the monolithic touchscreen in the center of the dashboard. The Tesla's low, flat floor makes for a spacious and airy feel inside. The front seats are supportive and comfortable, but the rear seats are cramped and uncomfortable; don't expect adults to be able to spend time in them. Folding the 60/40 split-folding rear seats is simple and expands the trunk considerably. The Model 3's seatbacks fold flat, too, providing an uninterrupted cargo floor for hauling larger items. With the rear seats folded, the Model 3 provides enough room for 15 carry-on suitcases. There are also generously sized bins and cubbies throughout the cabin.View PhotosTeslaThe Car and Driver DifferenceOur Comprehensive Car Testing ExplainedWhy We Test: Every Number Tells a StoryInfotainment and ConnectivityNavigation, Bluetooth, and USB connectivity are standard, but the Model 3 is oddly not available with AM radio or SiriusXM satellite radio. Several internet-streaming radio options are standard. It also can't be equipped with Android Auto or Apple CarPlay. To make charging-station layovers more bearable, the Model 3 offers plenty of entertainment options on its central display, including Netflix, YouTube, and a host of arcade games. How to Buy and Maintain a CarHow to Buy or Lease a New CarHow to Buy a Used CarHow to Repair, Maintain, and Care for Your CarSafety and Driver-Assistance FeaturesOverall Safety Rating (NHTSA)View Crash Test ResultsAlthough we question whether the name Autopilot might be misleading, the driver-assist system has one of the best feature sets in the industry, with smooth operation and impressive capabilities such as automatic lane changes. For more information about the Model 3's crash-test results, visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) websites. Key safety features include:        Standard automated emergency braking        Standard lane-departure warning        Standard adaptive cruise controlWarranty and Maintenance CoverageTesla's overall warranty coverage is among the longest in the EV segment, but it's disappointing that the coverage doesn't include corrosion protection. The Long Range model includes an additional 20,000 miles on the coverage period of its battery and drive components.        Limited warranty covers four years or 50,000 miles        Powertrain warranty covers eight years or 100,000 miles        No complimentary scheduled maintenanceSpecificationsSpecifications

Remarkable Range

With a range of well over 300 miles on a full charge, you can take longer road trips with confidence. Charging up the Model 3 is also easy—simply plug in at any public station or with the Tesla charging network of more than 30,000 Superchargers worldwide.





















Intelligent Design

Inside the Model 3, you’ll find a modern, spacious cabin with a minimal design aesthetic. All controls are intuitive, user-friendly, and can be accessed on a central 15-inch touchscreen and the steering wheel. An all-glass roof also offers an unparalleled view of the world from every seat.





















Built for Safety

The Tesla Model 3 is one of the safest cars on the road today, reflected in its NHTSA 5-star safety rating and IIHS Top Safety Pick+ award, with top ratings in all crashworthiness and front-crash prevention categories. The vehicle’s active safety features can also prevent accidents from happening altogether.

The Tesla Model 3 is among the best-selling EVs in the world, but does it qualify for a federal tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act?

           



The Tesla Model 3 is one of the world's best-selling electric vehicles, but does it qualify for a federal tax credit? The Model 3 expertly blends performance with affordability, with range and Autopilot, an advanced driver safety system, among the car’s selling points. The Model 3’s success in the automotive market is credited with Tesla’s leading position in the automaker food chain. Tesla's decision to focus on developing solely all-electric models led to the release of the Model Y crossover, the Model X luxury SUV, and the Model S sedan.

The Model 3's vast popularity has resulted in a high volume of purchases, with Tesla announcing that it had stopped receiving orders for the Long Range trim in 2022. Tesla CEO Elon Musk explained that due to an incredibly long waitlist, the automaker had to close the window for orders so that it could process and deliver those already in its database. Apart from its existing lineup, Tesla has a few other vehicles in the pipeline, including the Cybertruck pick-up and Semi truck.

Buyers appear to love the Model 3, with a handful of them voting for the EV to be named a top-rated car. Recently, owners of the Model 3 in the U.S. and Europe chose the car as “owners' favorite vehicle.” However, one factor that aids intending buyers in choosing an EV is the federal tax credit. Up until the Inflation Reduction Act was enacted, all Tesla vehicles, including the Model 3, could not receive the tax credit since Tesla has crossed the manufacturer sales cap of 200,000 vehicles. However, under the new Act, that sales cap will be eliminated starting next year. This means that while the Model 3 currently remains ineligible for the updated credit, it will once again qualify for a $7,500 tax rebate starting Jan. 1, 2023.





 Implications Of The Inflation Reduction Act
          



 With the Inflation Reduction Act, the federal tax credit (formerly called the Qualified Plug-in Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit) will now be named the Clean Vehicle Credit. The Act is designed to not just encourage more people to buy an EV, but is also considered a big step toward reducing healthcare costs and softening the blow of climate change. While new requirements have been included, the IRS is expected to add extra stipulations. One of the new rules is that only electric models whose production or assembly was completed in North America qualify for the credit. This decision trimmed a list of 72 vehicles to an initial list of 31 vehicles.




The list provided by the U.S. Department of Energy currently includes EVs that have completed final assembly in North America. Additionally, the Act stipulates that qualifying SUVs, pickup trucks, and vans need to be priced under $80,000, while sedans, hatchbacks, station wagons, and other EVs need to be priced below $55,000. While Tesla's models make the new list, only Model 3 vehicles purchased in 2023 will be eligible for the tax rebate.
