A typical future classic.Marc ThiesbürgerCorporate Communications and Policy BMW Group ClassicThe End. Finished. Done. Production of the BMW i8 is over. While car enthusiasts may suppress a tear or two, those in charge of the BMW Museum and the custodians of the huge classic cars collection at BMW Group Classic will be thrilled to welcome a lively new addition. A car that, with its elegance and innovativeness, still outshines almost every newer vehicle – and not just the sporty ones. Innovation leader and future classic Marc Thiesbürger from BMW Group Classic has no doubt that the BMW plug in hybrid sports car (➜ Read more: Electric cars and hybrids explained) will not be forgotten any time soon. “The BMW i8 combines many unique attributes,” explains the company history expert, “sports car, coupé or roadster, pioneer, brand-shaper, innovator, future-oriented design. A typical future classic.”The design of the BMW i8 was futuristic when production began in 2014 – and still is today. Showing its age? Far from it for this BMW sports car. On the contrary, whether it’s a BMW i8 roadster or coupé, even today they both still represent a glimpse of the car of tomorrow. The aerodynamically sophisticated design of the BMW i8 can be traced back to the concept study BMW Vision EfficientDynamics, which was first presented to the public at the 2009 International Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt, Germany.The production version of the BMW i8 had a flat front hood, air curtains in the front apron, a paneled underbody and air ducts between the taillights and the roof frame. Result: a drag coefficient (CW value) of just 0.26. The 2009 concept study featured gullwing doors, a plug-in hybrid, all-wheel drive – and all of these features also shaped the production version, which hit the streets in the spring of 2014.1 / 6 It all started with the BMW Vision EfficientDynamics concept vehicle. The car debuted at the 2009 International Motor Show in Frankfurt, Germany. The concept car featured all the technologies that would later characterize the BMW i8.  Powerful and resource-efficient The first BMW plug-in hybrid combined the best of both worlds: it brings together sheer driving pleasure (➜ Read more: The history of the BMW slogan) and excellent driving performance – the two factors that make up the essence of a sports car – with the resource-efficient and environmentally friendly technology of an electric propulsion system. The thing is, there isn’t just one BMW i8 engine – the BMW sports car’s drive unit consists of both a combustion engine and an electric engine (➜ Read more: 12 standout examples of a BMW engine).The combustion engine with BMW TwinPower Turbo technology provides power to the rear wheels, while the electric motor drives the front wheels. The result is an all-wheel drive. A high degree of traction is therefore always guaranteed – as well as necessary. Thanks to the 250 Nm torque of the electric engine and the 320 Nm of the combustion engine, the BMW i8 delivers sports car numbers for acceleration. At the same time, if desired, the hybrid sports car can reach speeds of up to around 75 mph (120 km/h) in electric mode, meaning locally emission-free. All told, this cutting-edge performance means the performance of a sports car, with the fuel consumption of a small car. A sports car that can well and truly count itself among the ranks of low emission cars.The electric motor initially provided a peak output of 96 kW (129 hp), a figure that reached 105 kW (141 hp) by the end of production. In combination with the three-cylinder gasoline engine, this means the BMW i8 horsepower figure for the car’s system output was 369 hp, or 275 kW. This made it possible to achieve figures of less than five seconds for the standard 0-60 mph sprint test (and for the roughly equivalent 0-100 km/h sprint test) (➜ Read more: From 0 to 60). Just as importantly, and to round out the BMW i8 specs, in all-electric mode the hybrid achieved a range of over 30 miles (50 kilometre) in the statutory test cycle. Sustainable in every way The chassis and body are no less revolutionary than the propulsion system. The passenger cell is made of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and is combined with an aluminum chassis: perfection in lightweight construction. Not only that, but BMW’s engineers achieved a perfect axle load distribution of 50:50. And, because of the deep and central location of the battery, the vehicle boasts a very low center of gravity – with the result that the driving experience tends to come out high on the driving pleasure scale.The BMW i8 also proved that sports car construction and sustainability (➜ Read more: The best upcycling ideas) are not mutually exclusive. The materials used included leather tanned with an extract from olive tree leaves, innovative textiles containing polyester granulate partly derived from recycled PET, and aluminum that was mostly obtained through recycling. And if that’s not enough for you… when it launched, the BMW i8 was the world’s first production vehicle that could be equipped with laser headlights, which considerably reduce the lighting systems’ energy consumption. And, of course, the main advantage is that the increased light output improves driving safety. “The first of its kind” And the conclusion after six years of production? That task falls to Marc Thiesbürger from BMW Group Classic, who sums up the importance of the BMW i8 as follows: “We can already be sure today that this BMW will become a classic of the future, thanks to the many unique properties it has brought together for the first time. In 20 years’ time people will say it was the first of its kind.”Photos/Video: BMW; Author: Nils Arnold THE 5  Find out more More articles Technology  12 engine milestones: from aircraft to electric propulsion  Classic car  A big history for the small Isetta  Festival  Portugal.

The BMW i8 is a plug-in hybrid sports car developed by BMW. The i8 was part of BMW's electrified fleet and was marketed under the BMW i sub-brand. The production version of the BMW i8 was unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show and was released in Germany in June 2014.[12] Deliveries to retail customers in the U.S. began in August 2014.[13] A roadster variant was launched in May 2018.[14] Production ended in June 2020.[15]
The 2015 BMW i8 accelerated from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.4 seconds[16][17] and had an electronically limited top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph).[5] The 2015 model year i8 had a 7.1-kWh lithium-ion battery pack that delivered an all-electric range of 37 km (23 mi) under the New European Driving Cycle. Under the U.S. EPA cycle, the range in EV mode was 24 km (15 mi).[8] The battery capacity of both the BMW i8 Roadster and the i8 Coupe was increased to 11.6 kWh in 2018, allowing the NEDC electric range to rise to 55 km (34 mi) for the coupé and 53 km (33 mi) for the roadster.[6]
The BMW i8 coupé had a fuel efficiency of 2.1 L/100 km (134.5 mpg‑imp; 112.0 mpg‑US) under the NEDC test with carbon emissions of 49 g/km. The EPA rated the i8 combined fuel economy at 76 MPGe (3.1 L gasoline-equivalent/100 km; 91 mpg-imp gasoline-equivalent) and 29 miles per gallon (6.7L/100 km) when running in pure gasoline mode.[8]
By March 2020, global sales of all variants had reached more than 20,000 units, making the BMW i8 the world's top-selling plug-in electric sports car, and exceeding sales of all competitors in its segment combined.[6]

History[edit]
First introduced as the Concept Vision EfficientDynamics, the i8 was part of BMW's "Project i" and was marketed as a new brand, BMW i, sold separately from BMW or Mini. The BMW i3, launched for customers in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2013, was the first model of the i brand available in the market, and it was followed by the i8, released in Germany in June 2014 as a 2015 model year. Other i models were expected to follow.[12][18][19]
The initial turbodiesel concept car was unveiled at the 2009 International Motor Show Germany,[20] In 2010, BMW announced the mass production of the Vision EfficientDynamics concept in Leipzig beginning in 2013 as the BMW i8.[21] The BMW i8 gasoline-powered concept car destined for production was unveiled at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show.[22] The production version of the BMW i8 was unveiled at the 2013 International Motor Show Germany.[23] The following are the concept and pre-production models developed by BMW that preceded the production version. When BMW i sponsored the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, they announced that they would provide support vehicles; the i8 operated as the official safety car.

BMW Vision EfficientDynamics (2009)[edit]
 Vision EfficientDynamics concept vehicle at the 2010 Paris Motor Show
BMW Vision EfficientDynamics concept car was a plug-in hybrid with a 1.5L three-cylinder turbo-diesel engine.[20] Additionally, there were two electric motors with 104 kW (139 hp). It allowed an acceleration to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.8 seconds, with an electronically limited top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph).[21]
According to BMW, the average fuel consumption in the EU test cycle (KV01) was 3.76 L/100 km (75.1 mpg‑imp), with a carbon dioxide emission rating of 99 grams per kilometer (1,3 L/100 km and 33g CO2/kabelham; EU-PHEV ECE-R101). The estimated all-electric range was 50 km (31 mi), and the 24-liter petrol tank extended the total vehicle range to up to 700 km (430 mi).[21] The lightweight chassis was made mainly from aluminum. The windshield, top, doors, and fenders were made from polycarbonate glass, with the body having a drag coefficient of 0.22.[24][25]
The designers of the BMW Vision EfficientDynamics concept were Mario Majdandzic for the exterior and Jochen Paesen (lead interior design), Markus Speck (interior design), and Felix Staudacher former Baerlin (detail design) for the interior. While Jochen Paesen took care of the main interior theme, Markus Speck was in charge of the seats, all the visible structure, and some details. Felix Baerlin supported Jochen Paesen on details including the steering wheel and center console.[26]
The vehicle was unveiled at the 2009 International Motor Show Germany,[27][28] followed by Auto China 2010.[29]


BMW i8 Concept (2011)[edit]
 BMW i8 Concept exhibited at the 2011 International Motor Show Germany.
The BMW i8 Concept plug-in hybrid electric vehicle included an electric motor located in the front axle powering the front wheels rated 96 kW (131 PS; 129 hp) and 250 N⋅m (184 ft⋅lb), a turbocharged 1.5-liter 3-cylinder gasoline engine driving rear wheels rated 164 kW (223 PS; 220 hp) and 300 N⋅m (221 ft⋅lb) of torque, with combined output of 260 kW (354 PS; 349 hp) and 550 N⋅m (406 ft⋅lb), a 7.2 kWh (26 MJ) lithium-ion battery pack that allowed an all-electric range of 35 km (22 mi). All four wheels provided regenerative braking. The location of the battery pack in the energy tunnel gave the vehicle a low centre of gravity, enhancing its dynamics. Its top speed was electronically limited to 250 km/h (155 mph) and was expected to go from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 60 mph) in 4.6 seconds. Under normal driving conditions the i8 was expected to deliver 80 mpg‑US (2.9 L/100 km; 96 mpg‑imp) under the European cycle. A full charge of the battery would take less than two hours at 220 V.[22][30] The positioning of the motor and engine over the axles resulted in 50/50 weight distribution.[30][31][32]
The vehicle was unveiled at the 2011 International Motor Show Germany, followed by CENTER 548 in New York City,[33] 42nd Tokyo Motor Show 2011,[34] 82nd Geneva Motor Show 2012,[35] BMW i Born Electric Tour at the Palazzo Delle Esposizioni at Via Nazionale 194 in Rome,[36] and Auto Shanghai 2013.[37]
This concept car was featured in the film Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.

BMW i8 Concept Spyder (2012)[edit]
 BMW i8 Concept Spyder
The BMW i8 Concept Spyder included a slightly shorter wheelbase and overall length compared to the BMW i8 Concept, carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) Life module, drive modules made primarily from aluminum components, interlocking of surfaces and lines, 8.8-inch (22.4 cm) screen display, off-white outer layer, and orange-toned naturally tanned leather upholstery.[38]
The vehicle was unveiled at Auto China 2012 in Beijing[39] where it won Concept Car of the Year,[40][41][42] followed by the 83rd Geneva International Motor Show 2013.[43] The designer of the BMW i8 Concept Spyder was Richard Kim.[3][44]

BMW i8 coupe prototype (2013)[edit]
The design of the BMW i8 coupe prototype was based on the BMW i8 Concept. The BMW i8 prototype had an average fuel efficiency of less than 2.5 L/100 km (113.0 mpg‑imp; 94.1 mpg‑US) under the New European Driving Cycle with carbon emissions of less than 59 g/km. The i8 with its carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) passenger cell lightweight, aerodynamically optimized body, and BMW eDrive technology offered the dynamic performance of a sports car, with an expected 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) sprint time of less than 4.5 seconds using both power sources. The plug-in hybrid system of the BMW i8 comprised a three-cylinder, 1.5-liter BMW TwinPower Turbo gasoline engine combined with BMW eDrive technology used in the BMW i3 and developed maximum power of 170 kW (228 hp). The BMW i8 was the first BMW production model to be powered by a three-cylinder gasoline engine and the resulting specific output of 115 kW (154 hp) per liter of displacement was on par with high-performance sports car engines and was the highest of any engine produced by the BMW Group.[4]

 BMW Vision Efficient Dynamics concept exhibited at the BMW i store in Park Lane, London.
The BMW i8's second power source was a hybrid synchronous electric motor specially developed and produced by the BMW Group for BMW i. The electric motor developed maximum power of 131 hp (98 kW) and produced its maximum torque of around 320 N⋅m (236 lbf⋅ft) from a standstill. Typical of an electric motor, responsive power was instantly available when starting and this continued into the higher load ranges. As well as providing a power boost to assist the gasoline engine during acceleration, the electric motor could also power the vehicle by itself. Top speed in electric mode was approximately 120 km/h (75 mph), with a maximum driving range of up to 35 km (22 mi). Linear acceleration was maintained even at higher speeds since the interplay between the two power sources efficiently absorbed any power flow interruptions when shifting gears. The model-specific version of the high-voltage 7.2 lithium-ion battery had a liquid cooling system and could be recharged at a conventional household power socket, at a BMW I Wallbox, or at a public charging station. In the US, a full recharge took approximately 3.5 hours from a conventional 120 V, 12 amp household circuit or approximately 1.5 hours from a 240 V Level 2 charger.[4][45]
The driver could select several driving modes: SPORT, COMFORT, and ECO PRO. Using the gear selector, the driver could either select position D for automated gear selection or could switch to SPORT mode. SPORT mode offered manual gear selection and at the same time switched to sporty drive and suspension settings. In SPORT mode, the engine and electric motor delivered extra performance, accelerator response was faster, and the power boost from the electric motor was maximized. And to keep the battery topped up, SPORT mode also activated maximum energy recuperation during overrun and braking as the electric motor's generator function, which recharged the battery using kinetic energy, switched to a more powerful setting. The Driving Experience Control switch on the center console offered a choice of two settings. On starting, COMFORT mode was activated, which offered a balance between performance and fuel efficiency, with unrestricted access to all convenience functions. Alternatively, the ECO PRO mode could be engaged, which, on the BMW i8 as on other models, supported an efficiency-optimized driving style. In this mode, the powertrain controller coordinated the cooperation between the gasoline engine and the electric motor for maximum fuel economy. On deceleration, the intelligent energy management system automatically decided, in line with the driving situation and vehicle status, whether to recuperate braking energy or to coast with the powertrain disengaged. At the same time, ECO PRO mode also programmed electrical convenience functions such as the air conditioning, seat heating, and heated mirrors to operate at minimum power consumption, but without compromising safety. The maximum driving range of the BMW i8 on a full fuel tank and with a fully charged battery was more than 500 km (310 mi) in COMFORT mode, which could be increased by up to 20% in ECO PRO mode. The BMW i8's ECO PRO mode could also be used during all-electric operation. The vehicle was then powered solely by the electric motor. Only if the battery charge dropped below a given level, or under sudden intense throttle application such as kick down, was the internal combustion engine automatically activated.
The vehicle was unveiled in BMW Group's Miramas test track in France.[4][46]

Production version[edit]

The production BMW i8 was designed by Benoit Jacob.[2] The production version was unveiled at the 2013 International Motor Show Germany,[18] followed by 2013 Les Voiles de Saint-Tropez.[47] Its design was heavily influenced by the BMW M1 Homage concept car, which in turn pays homage to BMW's last production mid-engined sports car prior to the i8: the BMW M1.[48][49]
The BMW i8 featured butterfly doors, head-up display, rear-view cameras and partially false engine noise.[50] Series production of customer vehicles began in April 2014.[5] The electric two-speed drivetrain was developed and produced by GKN.[51][52][53] It was the first production car with laser headlights, reaching farther than LED lights.[54]
The i8 had a vehicle weight of 1,485 kg (3,274 lb) (DIN kerb weight) and a low drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.26. In all-electric mode, the BMW i8 had a top speed of 120 km/h (75 mph). In Sport mode, the i8 delivered a mid-range acceleration from 80 to 120 km/h (50 to 75 mph) in 2.6 seconds. The electronically controlled top speed was 250 km/h (155 mph).[5]
The 20,000th i8 was produced in December 2019, one of the limited Ultimate Sophisto Edition models.[6] The last i8 rolled off the production line on 11 June 2020.[55] In total, there were 20,465 units produced: 16,581 coupés and 3,884 roadsters.[56]

Range and fuel economy[edit]
The production i8 had a 7.1 kWh lithium-ion battery pack with a usable capacity of 5.2 kWh and intelligent energy management that delivered an all-electric range of 37 km (23 mi) under the NEDC cycle. Under the EPA cycle, the range in EV mode was 15 mi (24 km), and the total range was 330 mi (530 km).[8]
The production version had a fuel efficiency of 2.1 L/100 km (134.5 mpg‑imp; 112.0 mpg‑US) under the NEDC test with carbon emissions of 49 g/km.[5] Under EPA cycle, the i8 combined fuel economy in EV mode was rated 76 equivalent (MPG-equivalent) (3.1 L gasoline equivalent/100 km; 91 mpg-imp gasoline equivalent), with an energy consumption of 43 kW-hrs/100 mi and gasoline consumption of 0.1 gal-US/100 mi. The combined fuel economy when running only with gasoline (after the battery was drained empty) was 28 mpg‑US (8.4 L/100 km; 34 mpg‑imp) for city driving, and 29 mpg‑US (8.1 L/100 km; 35 mpg‑imp) on the highway.[8][57]
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 2014 edition of the Light-Duty Automotive Technology, Carbon Dioxide Emissions, and Fuel Economy Trends introduced utility factors for plug-in hybrids to represent the percentage of miles that would be driven using electricity by an average driver, in electric only or blended modes. The BMW i8 Coupé had an EV mode utility factor of 37%, compared with 83% for the BMW i3 REx, 66% for the Chevrolet Volt, 65% for the Cadillac ELR, 45% for the Ford Energi models, 43% for the McLaren P1, 39% for the Porsche Panamera S E-Hybrid, and 29% for the Toyota Prius PHV.[58]
The battery capacity of both models launched in 2018, BMW i8 Roadster and the i8 Coupé, was increased to a gross energy content of 11.6 kWh. This, and other improvements, increased the all-electric range to 55 km (34 mi) for the BMW i8 Coupé and 53 km (33 mi) for the BMW i8 Roadster, both under the NEDC test.[6] Under the U.S. EPA driving cycle, the range only increased from 15 mi (24 km) to 18 mi (29 km).[59][9]
The following are the BMW i8 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ratings for all-electric range and fuel economy for all variants of the i8 between 2014 and 2020 model years.

Special edition[edit]
The special-edition BMW i8 Protonic Red Edition model was unveiled at the 2016 Geneva International Motor Show.[60] The Protonic Red Edition was produced at BMW Plant Leipzig from July 2016. This special edition car sported a Protonic Red paint finish with accents in Frozen Grey metallic. The colour scheme was complemented by BMW W-spoke 470 light-alloy wheels painted in Orbit Grey metallic with hubs painted in Aluminium matte and mixed-size tires (front: 215/45 R20, rear: 245/40 R20). Inside, the car featured red double-stitching and applications in high-grade carbon fibre and ceramic trim.[61]

Roadster[edit]
 2018 BMW i8 Roadster
The BMW i8 Spyder concept was unveiled at the 2012 Beijing Auto Show. In October 2016, BMW announced that the roadster variant would be added to the BMW i line-up in 2018.[62][63] The production version of the BMW i8 Roadster was premiered in late 2017, and delivery of the first 18 exclusive first edition units took place in May 2018.[6][14]
The battery cell capacity of both models, coupé and roadster, was increased from 20 to 34 Ah and a gross energy content of 11.6 kWh. At the same time, optimized battery cell technology made it possible to increase the peak output of the electric motor by 9 kW/12 hp to 105 kW/143 hp.[6] These improvements made it possible for the BMW i8 Coupé to accelerate from zero to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.4 seconds, while the BMW i8 Roadster took 4.6 seconds. Both models reached a top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph). The all-electric range rose to 55 km (34 mi) for the BMW i8 Coupé and to 53 km (33 mi) for the BMW i8 Roadster.[6] The BMW i8 Roadster had only two seats, and the roof was an electric two-piece unit, which neatly folded into space where the rear seats would normally be.

Still, the BMW provides a show-stopping entrance regardless of whether its dihedral doors open on the hardtop coupe or convertible roadster. While its plug-in powertrain is respectably powerful—and quicker than lesser hybrids—you're more likely to see one tear around a Whole Foods parking lot than your local racetrack. A user-friendly ride and comfortable front seats make the 2020 i8 usable every day; however, its limited storage space and compromised cabin access might cross it off most people's list.More Model Years2019 BMW i8What's New for 2020?After earning a subtle makeover for 2019, which included updated battery technology and the addition of the convertible roadster, the 2020 i8 lineup carries over unchanged.Pricing and Which One to BuyCoupe$148,495Roadster$164,295We'd pony up the extra cash for the open-air driving experience that is only available with the 2020 i8 roadster. With standard all-wheel drive and only one powertrain, those decisions are already made for you. Every model has niceties such as leather upholstery, a head-up display, heated front seats, a Harman/Kardon sound system, and Apple CarPlay integration. However, we'd spice things up with the Tera World package that brings ceramic controls, black brake calipers, blue seatbelts, and an exclusive brown interior. Most exterior colors are no-cost options except for the Crystal White paint with blue or grey accents. Those looking to maximize the i8's wow factor should consider adding the adaptive LED headlights with what BMW calls Laserlight.EV Motor, Power, and PerformanceBMW offers a single powertrain in the i8. It mates a turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder gas engine with an 11.6-kWh battery pack and two electric motors. The trio of power sources combines for a total of 369 horsepower, capable of driving all four wheels. However, it's not the fastest supercar on the block: The 2019 i8 roadster we tested sprinted from zero to 60 mph in 4.1 seconds. The i8 suffers from the same light steering that we've criticized in many current BMWs. We'd prefer more feedback, especially in a vehicle with sporting intentions. The ride is surprisingly civil and bumps in the road are felt, but never harshly.View PhotosBMWMore on the BMW i8View Photos of the 2019 BMW i8 Roadster2019 BMW i8 Roadster Driveni-Opener: 2019 BMW i8 RoadsterFuel Economy and Real-World MPGeThe i8's EPA fuel-economy ratings are unimpressive among hybrids but still better than most sports cars. During our 200-mile highway fuel-economy test, the roadster delivered 35 MPGe and went for 22 miles on electricity alone.Interior, Comfort, and CargoDespite the i8's focus on design versus practicality, front-seat occupants won't feel cramped. The i8 roadster has seating for only two passengers, with the folding top taking up the space that is occupied by a pair of jump seats in the coupe. Standard interior features include heated power seats and touches of leather. Cooled seats, a power-adjustable steering wheel, and passenger-seat lumbar support are not available—even as options. As you might expect, the i8 has a negligible amount of room for luggage and minimal cubby space for the trinkets of modern life. The i8's rear cargo area is long but shallow—unlike some mid-engined sports cars, there's no storage in a front trunk—and we managed to fit only a single carry-on suitcase inside.View PhotosBMWThe Car and Driver DifferenceOur Comprehensive Car Testing ExplainedWhy We Test: Every Number Tells a StoryInfotainment and ConnectivityThe i8's infotainment system will be familiar to owners of less exotic BMWs. The system is largely intuitive and displays on a sharp-looking 8.8-inch touchscreen situated atop the dashboard. Apple CarPlay capability is standard, but Android Auto isn't offered on any i8 model.How to Buy and Maintain a CarHow to Buy or Lease a New CarHow to Buy a Used CarHow to Repair, Maintain, and Care for Your CarSafety and Driver-Assistance FeaturesThe 2020 i8 hasn't been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). While it has some standard driver-assistance technology, many common assists such as blind-spot monitoring and adaptive cruise control are absent. Key safety features include:      Standard automated emergency braking      Standard forward-collision warning      Standard front and rear parking sensorsWarranty and Maintenance CoverageBMW's standard set of warranties is typical for a luxury automaker. Also typical is the i8's warranty on hybrid-powertrain components. Its complimentary scheduled maintenance, however, sets the i8 apart from the competition.      Limited warranty covers 4 years or 50,000 miles      Powertrain warranty covers 4 years or 50,000 miles      Hybrid components are covered for 8 years or 100,000 miles      Complimentary scheduled maintenance is covered for 3 years or 36,000 milesBMWBMW2023 M2Starting at $63,195 BMW2023 XMStarting at $159,995 BMW2023 Z4Starting at $53,795 C/D Rating9/10BMW2023 X4 MStarting at $77,395 C/D Rating8/10Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowBMW2023 X4Starting at $54,395 C/D Rating8/10BMW2023 4-Series Gran CoupeStarting at $46,895 C/D Rating8.5/10BMW2023 X5Starting at $62,595 C/D Rating9.5/10BMW2023 5-SeriesStarting at $55,795 C/D Rating7.5/10BMW2023 X3Starting at $46,395 C/D Rating9/10BMW2023 4-seriesStarting at $48,395 C/D Rating8.5/10BMW2023 i4Starting at $56,895 C/D Rating9/10BMW2023 X2Starting at $37,595 C/D Rating8.5/10Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowNewsletterContact UsHow We Test CarsHearst AutosSubscribeGive a GiftCustomer ServiceRSS FeedA Part of Hearst Digital MediaWe may earn a commission for purchases made through our links.©Hearst Autos, Inc.

2019 BMW i8 review: Our expert's take


BMW has updated its hybrid electric i8 model, giving it more power, more range, a bigger battery and, most significantly, a new roadster model that features a powered convertible top. The new i8 roadster and updated coupe will go on sale as 2019 models in spring 2018.
 


Exterior
The changes externally are minimal, with few design differences between the 2018 and 2019 coupe. But the big news is obviously the roadster, which loses the two vestigial “plus 2” rear seats in favor of a power-retractable soft-top and separate articulated rear window.
The insulated fabric panel folds using a Z formation and stows underneath a hard tonneau cover in just 16 seconds and at speeds up to 31 mph, according to BMW. If you worry that losing the roof means that the i8 will also lose its novel butterfly doors, fear not — the car retains its cool doors, ready to let you show off when you roll up to your destination. In addition to the new top, two new colors arrive for the 2019 model year: E-Copper and Donnington Grey.
Interior
No styling changes have been made inside, but new colors and trim options have been created. Standard is a sport steering wheel and multifunction display, with Giga interior trim colors in Ivory White leather for the coupe and Ivory White/Black leather for the roadster. A dark Amido interior color is standard for both models, and the optional Halo interior trim features a Carum/Dalbergia color scheme, or spend a little more and opt for the high-end Tera World Copper interior trim.
The electronics include standard navigation with the latest BMW iDrive 6.0, which allows the user to use either the touch controller on the center console or the 8.8-inch touchscreen in the dash for input and control. The standard audio system is a Harman Kardon HiFi premium system with 12 speakers. A head-up display is also standard, which changes information displayed based on the drive mode.
Under the Hood
The i8 coupe and roadster keep the car’s unusual and complicated hybrid setup: a turbocharged three-cylinder gas engine that powers the rear wheels under hard acceleration via a six-speed Steptronic automatic transmission combined with an electric motor that powers the front wheels full time using a two-speed automatic transmission. The two combine for seamless all-wheel drive, but for 2019 the system favors the electric drive even more, aiming to keep the car in electric mode more often. The gas engine acts as a generator to charge up the batteries most of the time, but can add power to the wheels directly when called upon.
The battery capacity has been boosted, too. It’s now an 11.6-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion unit. As a result, the i8’s electric-only range has increased and is now preliminarily rated at 18 miles by BMW. The zero-to-60-mph time has dropped to 4.2 seconds for the coupe. For the all-new roadster, the time is 4.4 seconds.
Five drive modes are again available, tailoring the car to the driver’s situation and desired responsiveness. The roadster receives 20-inch wheels as standard, but like the coupe offers four different design choices. Also standard is Dynamic Damper Control and an adjustable suspension for both models.
Safety
The new 2019 i8 coupe and roadster both include standard adaptive cruise control, as well as the Driving Assistant Package. The safety package includes a surround-view camera, frontal collision warning with pedestrian detection and autonomous braking, front and rear parking sensors with cross-traffic alert, and automatic high-beam headlights.

Kinda perfect (for me)

August 12, 2022
By Will J from Los Angeles, Ca
Owns this car


This is my second i8. I leased a 2019 for 14 months (lease takeover) and loved it. I was cross-shopping AMG GT, Bentley Continental GT, 911, Taycan, Vantage and Tesla Model S.

My decision was based on my needs...

I'm a car guy. I love exotics, but I'm also aware of fossil fuel issues and don't want to look back as part of the problem. So I wanted it all, an exotic with fuel efficiency,  four seats, mid-engine, modern technology, and not a car with millions of iterations (like the 911). 

To drive, it's fascinating and not in a way I expected. To start with I was trying to get close to the Car and Driver 0-60 of 3.6s, but after a while, I was more interested in the fuel economy. Weirdly, I bought a car to go fast without being terrible for the environment, but in the end, I didn't want to go as fast as I wanted to see my mpg nudge up, which it did if I charged it regularly (presently I'm running at an average of 38mpg and climbing). I still accelerate fast, and pop it into sport when I need the supercar acceleration, but mostly I use it, day to day as the most enjoyable, engaging car I've owned. I've owned sub 4 second cars for a while, and some are more thrilling, but like I said, I wanted it all.

So, the usual complaints: 

Too much plastic inside the car? Well, maybe, slightly, but look at the specs, and the environmentally friendly materials involved are staggering, and the unique carbon fiber and leather and stitching everywhere is an achievement to say the least. The interior is gorgeous, as is the subtle interior lighting, and still feels way more modern than the competitors, apart from the Mercedes maybe, and obviously the Tycan.

Not a real supercar? Well, you decide: carbon fiber tub, no derivative versions (like the 911), sub 4s 0-60, eagle wing doors, mid engine, and such a low center of gravity that it sticks to the road like glue, even with tires that are fat compared to the Tesla, but thin compared to the Porsche. 

Less road feel. Yes, compared to the 911 (I used to have a 2013 GTS) it's no comparison. The 911 is the most engaging drive, I think, in the world, so I was amazed that I didn't miss it.

I think the reviewers who look at this car have nothing to compare it to. The supercar stats are all 2 seaters that burn fuel at 4-6x that of the i8. The electric comparisons have none of the thrills, looks, or most importantly to me, the hybrid practicality.

The only comparisons, really are either the NSX (hybrid supercar) but it has 1/3 the fuel economy and only two seats) but faster, or the P100d or Tycan 4s (faster but no hybrid, 4 door saloon, and well, you see 100 every day in Los Angeles)

So you see, there isn't really a comparison, at least, not for me. This review isn't really designed to convince you to buy this car, more to understand the reason it's without doubt the best car... for me.

BTW, my best 0-60 on the street, on a hot day, with Pirellis was 3.9s 0-60, and I nearly killed myself doing it. Instead, I'll use the power to get on the freeway, and surprise the Ferrari California that I'm faster than in the real world.

Also, my 5'9 15 yr old fits in the back just fine for short journeys (<30m). 5'6" is the magic number for comfort in the back, but for shopping, you can fit 10 full bags from Trader Joes, and more in the trunk.

The BMW i8 is a weird and brilliant car and that's why, in 15 years, it will probably be a collector's car worth more than anyone paid for it. Everyone looks at it (every day, even in 2022, people can't help it), but you won't be able to help seeing how little fuel you're burning as you hit sixty in under 4 seconds.

Not for everyone, but definitely for me.

The styling is beautiful, and engineering to use a combination of elecreic and gas is outstanding. This car answers everything that I was looking for in a supercar.

a total waste of money buy a Maserati gt instead

August 28, 2019
By irishedd from manchester UK
Used to own this car


after spending 2 months with the 2019 car i think I know it well, yes it run son air and the youngsters love its look and the heads-up speedo is nice but that's about it.  If you want to drive around with a barbie doll beside you and get play the I am better than you game or pretend to be a footballer this is your car. The interior is so full of cheap-looking BMW parts and plastic that it is quite shocking considering the price. The back seats dont exist nor does luggage space. The leather interior is nice but below expectations on this price of car. A lot of my male adn female friends struggled to get into the car such is the problem with the high sills. This car is all fur coat and no underwear. My Maserati GT Mc sport was getting fixed after someone rearended me, and by god once I got back in it i just smiled. The Mas is 4 years old not as tecnically advanced as the BMW i8 . the infotainment is nowhere near as modern but if you offered me a brand new i8 in exchanged id say a huge no. Tje Maxerati is a proper car loads of things could be imporved on it but this BMW couldnt polish it wheels . To sum up the BMW 18 felt like I was driving a very lovely dodgem car . I prefer a real car.

      2022 BMW i8 Review, Pricing, Specs and Pictures

It wasn’t ever the fastest or most capable car in its price range but it offers a unique and interesting take on the supercar, while also packing stunning good looks and a bit of all-electric range. First launched as a series production car back in 2014, the first-ever plug-in hybrid sports car from BMW has quickly become the most successful performance vehicle in the world. The BMW i8 Coupe and i8 Roadster are the ultimate technological milestones of the BMW Group, blending in a spectacular and futuristic design with state-of-the-art engineering. The reason why the i8 is so important to BMW is the fact that it laid the foundation for future electrification of the entire range of models.Engine, Transmission, and PerformanceOne of the things that makes the BMW i8 so unique is its powertrain. The i8 essentially has two separate powertrains; a 1.5 liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine, paired with an electric motor, that powers the rear wheels, and a single electric motor that powers the front wheels. Total system power is 369 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque, which helps the i8 get from 0-60 mph in about 4.4 seconds. Interestingly, the BMW i8 was also the first hybrid/EV to use a two-speed transmission for its electric motor at the front.Fuel Economy and MPGThe whole point of making the BMW i8 a hybrid was to offer impressive fuel economy on top of supercar performance/styling. While the i8 isn’t as economical as BMW had hoped, it’s still more economical than most supercars, capable of returning 35 MPGe. Because of that front electric motor, the latest iteration of the BMW i8 can drive up to 22 miles on pure electric power alone.Interior and Cargo SpaceWhile most mid-engine supercars have both a rear and front trunk, the BMW i8 does not, as the front electric motor and transmission take up the space where a “frunk” would go. Also, the rear trunk isn’t capable of holding much of anything. An average-sized briefcase will take up the most of the rear trunk space. There’s also very little in the way of interior cargo space.The interior was also always the i8’s biggest criticism. While the exterior design is breathtaking, the interior design is both a bit too vanilla and a bit too low-rent for its price tag. It’s a sustainable interior with a lot of unique materials built with a minimalistic approach.InfotainmentBeing an older BMW, the i8 uses BMW’s iDrive 6 system, which is a bit behind the times. However, it’s still very functional, easy to use, and easy to understand. While owners of more modern BMWs might be disappointed by the i8’s infotainment system, it’s perfectly functional and usable, with all the necessary modern features.Safety and Driver-Assistance FeaturesThis is another area where the BMW i8 shows its age. Having debuted in 2014, with only a mild LCI facelift a few years later, the i8 lacks many of the driver-assistance features of more modern cars. It has things like automated emergency braking, forward collision warnings, and front and rear parking sensors but it lacks lane-keep assist, any of BMW’s Level 2 autonomy, and even blind-spot monitors. The last bit is especially frustrating when you consider the bad blind spots it has, inherent of mid-engine supercars.PricingWhen it was new, the BMW i8 started at $148,495. However, it’s no longer on sale and used examples can be had for well under $100,000. Considering the fact that it’s a mid-engine supercar with a hybrid powertrain, a carbon fiber monocoque chassis, and sports car performance, it’s actually a good deal on the used market. The 2020 i8 Roadster with its MSRP of $164,295 was at some point the most expensive BMW on sale, but some units at around 100,000 miles can be purchased for around $100,000.ModelsSeries1 Series2 Series3 Series4 Series5 Series6 Series7 Series8 SeriesM1MM1M2M3M4M5M6M8ii3i4i8iX3iXAll BMW iXX1X2X3X4X5X6X7ZZ3Z4Z8M SUVsX3 MX4 MX5 MX6 MXMRolls RoyceALPINATest DrivesNewsLatest NewsRacingConceptsRumorsInterestingInterestingEuropean DeliveryCar TipsHow-ToOthersAuto ShowsMotorradTuningLifestyleVideosSpy PhotosPodcastMINI    AboutAdvertiseContact            SectionsAboutContactAdvertiseTerms of UseSign Up NewsletterPrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationPrivacy CaliforniaGet the latest 2022 BMWBLOG | Change consent         2024 BMW i8 M: What We Know So FarSearchSubscribeGive a GiftNew CarsAcuraAlfa RomeoAston MartinAudiBentleyBMWBollingerBugattiBuickBytonCadillacChevroletChryslerDodgeFerrariFiatFiskerFordGenesisGMCHondaHyundaiInfinitiJaguarJeepKarmaKiaKoenigseggLamborghiniLand RoverLexusLincolnLordstownLotusLucid MotorsMaseratiMazdaMcLarenMercedes-AMGMercedes-BenzMercedes-MaybachMiniMitsubishiNikolaNissanPolestarPorscheRamRimacRivianRolls-RoyceSubaruTeslaToyotaVinFastVolkswagenVolvoReviewsFirst DrivesInstrumented TestsComparison TestsLong-Term Road TestsHow We TestFrom the ArchiveNewsAutonomous VehiclesTesting HubRecallsNew York Auto ShowFeatures10Best 2022EVsLightning Lap 2022ColumnsAutomotive HistoryBuyer's Guide2022 Editors' ChoiceFuture CarsLeasingUsed CarsCertified Pre-OwnedSUVs and CrossoversTrucksElectric VehiclesRecreational VehiclesMaintenanceCar InsuranceShopping AdviceNewsletterVideosFollowInstagramFacebookTwitterYouTubeShopDo Not Sell My Personal InformationPrivacy NoticeTerms Of UseSkip to ContentMakes & Modelssign inSubscribeReviewsNewsC/D ArchiveBuyer's Guide SubscribeReviewsNewsC/D ArchiveBuyer's Guide HomeBMWi8 M2024 BMW i8 M2024 BMW i8 MStarting at $160,000 estIllustration by Radovan Varicak|Car and DriverSelect a year2024By Drew DorianOverview Even though the current i8 hasn't lived up to the sporting intentions BMW had for it, that apparently hasn't put the German luxury brand off of high-dollar hybrid sports cars. Development of the next i8—we're a fan of calling it the i8 M, considering it should represent a significant performance improvement over the current model—is underway, and BMW's Vision M Next concept from mid-2019 is proof. A massive increase in power, a longer all-electric driving range, updated styling, and a more capable chassis are all expected to separate the i8 M from the model it will ultimately replace. What's New for 2024?The i8 M—or whatever BMW decides to call its next-generation hybrid sports car—will be all-new for the 2024 model year. We expect to find out more as we get closer to the car's on-sale date, which is predicted to be sometime in 2023 as a 2024 model.Pricing and Which One to BuyCoupe$160,000 (est)Roadster$180,000 (est)Without knowing how the i8 M will be equipped or what options may be available, it's hard to recommend a particular model. We expect the i8 M to be offered in both a fixed-roof coupe body style as well as a ragtop roadster, similar to the current model's lineup.Engine, Transmission, and PerformanceThe i8 M's plug-in hybrid powertrain is anticipated to follow the same basic setup as the current i8, which means an electric motor driving the front wheels and a mid-mounted gasoline engine and electric motor for the rear wheels. In lieu of the i8's turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder gas engine, BMW has said the new car will offer a turbocharged four-cylinder; the company also claims a total system output—gas and electric power combined—of 591 horsepower, which is far more than the i8's 369-hp output. This up-rated powertrain will help the i8 M compete with rivals such as the Acura NSX, Lexus LC500h, and Polestar 1.More on the BMW i8 M600-HP BMW i8 M Hybrid Sports Car Coming in 2023Range, Charging, and Battery Life The current i8's 18-mile electric driving range is unimpressive to say the least. BMW has been mum on details such as battery size but said electric driving range for the Vision M Next concept was a claimed 62 miles. That means either BMW's engineers found a way to squeeze a lot more miles out of the current car's 11.6-kWh battery pack or they found space for a much larger unit. It's almost certainly the latter. More information will be available regarding the i8 M's battery, range, and charging capability closer to the car's on-sale date.Fuel Economy and Real-World MPGThe EPA has not tested the i8 M or released estimates for its fuel consumption—which is not surprising since the car doesn't exist yet. In addition to improving electric driving range, we're expecting the i8 M to offer slightly better fuel economy ratings than the current i8, despite an anticipated improvement in acceleration and driving performance. For more information about the i8 M's fuel economy, visit the EPA's website.Interior, Comfort, and CargoLittle is known about the i8 M's cabin so far, but we are hoping BMW addresses the i8's difficult ingress and egress by equipping the new car with front-hinged doors and a lower side sill to make the interior more easily accessible. Like the current car, the i8 M will be BMW's playground for future styling and should feature unique materials, cutting-edge features, and eye-popping designs. Storage and cargo capacity will likely remain limited, but a front trunk (or "frunk") may make an appearance to provide additional luggage space.The Car and Driver DifferenceOur Comprehensive Car Testing ExplainedInfotainment and ConnectivityA lot can change in the world of in-car infotainment in three-plus years, so details about what might be offered in the i8 M are anyone's guess. In the Vision M Next concept, BMW showed off a futuristic take on infotainment that the company calls the Boost Pod; it consists of several glass screens and a head-up display to provide the driver access to car-related information and on-board entertainment features. How to Buy and Maintain a CarHow to Buy or Lease a New CarHow to Buy a Used CarHow to Repair, Maintain, and Care for Your CarSafety and Driver-Assistance FeaturesConsidering the i8 M is still a few years off, it's possible more advanced driver-assistance features will be featured, including perhaps a true autonomous driving system. Time will tell. For more information about the i8 M's crash-test results, visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) websites. Key safety features are likely to include:      Standard automated emergency braking with pedestrian detection      Standard lane-departure warning with lane-keeping assist      Available adaptive cruise control with semi-autonomous driving modeWarranty and Maintenance CoverageBMW's warranty coverage could change between now and 2024, but if everything holds steady in this area, expect the same warranty package that's available on today's lineup. A dedicated hybrid-components warranty is all but a certainty, and we're hoping BMW continues to offer a three-year complimentary maintenance plan for all new models.      Limited warranty covers 4 years or 50,000 miles      Powertrain warranty covers 4 years or 50,000 miles      Hybrid components are covered for 8 years or 100,000 miles      Complimentary maintenance is covered for 3 years or 36,000 miles Future Cars: What We Know So FarGMC2024 Sierra EVStarting at $108,695 Rolls-Royce2024 Rolls-Royce SpectreStarting at $400,000 estCadillac2024 CelestiqStarting at $300,000 estMercedes-Benz2023 EQE SUVStarting at $80,000 estAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowMercedes-AMG2024 AMG EQE53Starting at $110,000 estVinFast2023 VF8Starting at $43,500 estChevrolet2024 TraxStarting at $21,495 Polestar2024 3Starting at $85,300 BMW2023 M2Starting at $63,195 Volkswagen2023 TaosStarting at $25,450 C/D Rating8.5/10Mercedes-AMG2024 C63Starting at $85,000 estHonda2024 PrologueStarting at $45,000 estAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowNewsletterContact UsHow We Test CarsHearst AutosSubscribeGive a GiftCustomer ServiceRSS FeedA Part of Hearst Digital MediaWe may earn a commission for purchases made through our links.©Hearst Autos, Inc.
